Missionvale families to find out today if homes will be demolished The families living in 15 houses that were built on a flood plain in Missionvale will find out today if their homes are to be demolished. The Missionvale housing project is one of the city s biggest RDP bungles, which saw thousands of homes built before water and sewerage services were even installed. Speaking at a council meeting in Port Elizabeth yesterday, Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip said an investigation would be launched to uncover the truth behind the housing development bungle. This will not be repeated. Accountability is what prevents repetitive mistakes, he said. Some of the houses were built in low-lying areas which are prone to flooding. We have learnt lessons from the Missionvale bulk infrastructure issue, where 15 houses may need to be demolished because they were constructed on a floodplain, he said. Municipal human settlement executive director Mandla George said engineers would meet today to carry out a final assessment in Missionvale. We will also explore if some of the houses can be salvaged, he said. Trollip s announcement about a possible demolition comes after an audit report was commissioned by Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu about 10 months ago. The explosive report details how a complex web of corruption led to the construction bungle in Missionvale.
