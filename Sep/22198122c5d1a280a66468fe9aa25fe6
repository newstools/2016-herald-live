The Nelson Mandela Bay branch of the Patriotic Alliance (PA) had its feathers ruffled yesterday when a number of the party s members declared on social media that they had left the party. This follows weeks of turmoil and unhappiness in the party structures from before the August 3 local elections. Former PA regional chairman Justin Oliphant said he had decided to leave because of empty promises and a lack of transparency by the leadership, among other issues. Initially we were excited about the prospect of making positive changes in our community . . . but it turns out it s not what we expected, he said. Before the elections there had been numerous challenges about how things were done in the party and decisions had been made which did not include people who helped secure a seat [in the council] . Decisions should be made by the people, not just one or two others. The people in the community are the ones that matter, he said. Community activist and former PA member Shaun Tarentaal said he had left because people were not honest and when the PA came to Port Elizabeth four months ago it had made promises that were never met.
