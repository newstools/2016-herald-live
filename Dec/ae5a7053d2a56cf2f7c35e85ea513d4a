Criminals around Nelson Mandela Bay have discovered new techniques to line their pockets before Christmas. Police have warned residents and visitors to be more vigilant during the festive season. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said holiday operations had started in earnest. She advised motorists to take precautions to protect their vehicles and property. Policing will be enhanced during this period and offenders who disregard the law will be dealt with severely. Naidu said homeowners who did not have security systems extending into their garages should consider installing an upgrade. A number of garage break-ins had been reported recently. We are concerned about motorbikes being taken from locked garages, especially in the Westering and Kabega Park areas. We also advise residents to be on the lookout for suspicious vehicles in their neighbourhoods. She said multiple incidents had been reported in which occupants of a vehicle alerted other motorists about a flat tyre.
