MEC Nancy Sihlwayi Picture: SowetanLIVE We can t carry on paying for care centres Sihlwayi After weeks of obfuscation, Social Development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi finally admitted yesterday that the only two fully state-funded frail care centres in Port Elizabeth will close down at the end of the month, but was tight-lipped about the fate of the patients. Sihlwayi declined to say where and when the patients would be moved or who would care for them. However, she conceded at the media briefing in Port Elizabeth that with less than a month to go before the closure of the centres, her officials were working to tight deadlines. She said the department could no longer afford to pay the twoyear, R104-million contract. The affected Life Esidimeni centres Lorraine Frail Care and Algoa Frail Care house about 240 severely disabled and frail patients. But families should not worry, Sihlwayi said: We won t put them out on the street.
