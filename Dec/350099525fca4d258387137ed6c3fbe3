The prosecution in the #CoffinAssault case has opposed bail being granted to Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins saying the pair could intimidate witnesses. The Middelburg men are accused of beating and forcing Victor Mlotshwa inside a coffin. The hearing on Thursday morning was delayed as defence attorneys spent more than an hour consulting. Mlotshwa and his mother Lonea arrived early at the Middelburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court which was filled to capacity. There was a strong police presence. Oosthuizen and Martins were arrested after a video showing them forcing Mlotshwa into a coffin went viral trending under the #CoffinAssault hashtag. They abandoned their bail application last month citing security concerns. They are charged with assault with intent to do grievous body harm and kidnapping. Outside the court building members of the ANC and DA showed their support for Mlotshwa singing struggle songs. The EFF who had been present at the initial bail application which was characterised by political jockeying did not have representatives present on Thursday.
