Two motorists who were caught at high speeds on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth with one topping 180km/h are due to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court today. The two were nabbed during a provincial traffic operation on the N2 near Van Stadens yesterday. In addition to the arrests, 43 summonses for speeding were issued in the space of just four hours. The first motorist was chased down and arrested for allegedly travelling at 182km/h in a 120km/h zone at about 9am. The 27-year-old was travelling towards Port Elizabeth. Under the National Road Traffic Act, any motorist who exceeds the speed limit by 30km/h in an urban area or 40km/h in a non-urban area is subject to arrest and is issued with a summons to appear in court. Provincial traffic deputy director Charles Bramwell said officials from the Struandale office had been routine speed checking at about 9am on the N2 outside Port Elizabeth when the driver of a Toyota Etios failed to stop. He said traffic officials had given chase and the driver had eventually been forced off the N2. The driver was arrested and detained at the Kabega Park police station, Bramwell said. By 11am, traffic officials had also arrested a 31-year-old driver for allegedly driving at 169km/h. This driver also sped away in an attempt to evade arrest, he said. A chase ensued and he was arrested on the N2 entering Port Elizabeth. Bramwell said the arrests had been made by the special provincial traffic speed law enforcement team, which was using the latest speed detection equipment. The men were arrested for exceeding the speed limit as well as reckless and negligent driving, and would spend the night in holding cells.
