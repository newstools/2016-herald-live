Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune Image by: GALLO IMAGES Itumeleng Khune is likely to play in tomorrow s Absa Premiership clash for Kaizer Chiefs against Chippa United but Mulomowandau Mathoho will miss the game at centreback. The participation of veteran fullback Tsepo Masilela is also unsure and whether he and Khune will travel to Port Elizabeth may only be decided after an early morning training session today. Khune went off on Tuesday night with a strained muscle after making a point-blank save in the second half of the 1-1 draw with Cape Town City at the FNB Stadium. He had been undergoing treatment at Naturena, even though Chiefs had the day off yesterday after a recuperation session on Wednesday officials said. It was looking positive yesterday that Khune would recover and make the trip to the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, but Masilela must still be assessed today. If Masilela is not fit Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela faces a dilemma at leftback, because Sibusiso Khumalo was sent off on Tuesday night. Khumalo is suspended for the next two matches and if Masilela cannot make it then Komphela will have to utilise a makeshift fullback likely to be Daniel Cardoso or out-of-favour Kgotso Moleko who is usually employed on the right. If Cardoso is moved across and with Mathoho s groin injury not healed Komphela has to choose a central defensive partner for Lorenzo Gordinho. The coach can either give Siyanda Xulu who he has largely ignored over the last 18 months a rare run out, or use Moleko at rightback and push Ramahlwe Mphalale to centreback. Chiefs travel to Port Elizabeth with mounting pressure after their winless streak was stretched to six games on Tuesday against Cape Town City.
