Transnet National Ports Authority dispatched the chokka fishing vessel Squidder to assist the four crew who were clinging onto the upturned hull of their capsized boat In for Fun 1.5 nautical miles off-shore of the Eastern Cape port city. Sea rescuers from the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) who were also dispatched to the scene found the four crew members &#8211; a South African man who was the skipper and owner of the stricken boat two Romanian men and British woman safe aboard the fishing vessel. The casualties were taken ashore aboard Squidder and we towed their capsized boat to the Darby Venture Crane which was used to right the boat and the righted casualty craft we then towed to Pedsac slipway where it was recovered said Ian Gray NSRI Port Elizabeth station commander. We believe the boat capsized after lines they had in the water had fouled their motors causing the boat to be swamped by water and rolling over and none of the four were injured and they required no further assistance Gray added.
