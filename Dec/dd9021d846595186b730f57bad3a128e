Holiday cheer is palpable in Nelson Mandela Bay and other coastal centres as families who have made their weary way to year-end destinations finally get to put their feet up and unwind in the festive long weekends ahead. For many it is a well-earned break, not only from work but from a year that on the national front has had its fair share of turmoil and not-socomforting news anything from dirty politics and rising costs, to a crippling drought and water restrictions. And let s not even get started on the tragi-comedy which is our national broadcaster. But it is also a time of year when due to the sheer volume of people enjoying leisure activities, danger lurks not only on roads, but in many other situations where there has already been tragic loss of life or close calls. Just two days ago, lifeguards had to go to the rescue of four foreigners who were swept out to sea by treacherous rip currents at Wilderness. With hot weather largely anticipated in the days ahead, beaches in the metro and scores of resorts in the Eastern and Southern Cape will be packed and authorities, emergency services, sea rescue and life-saving teams are no doubt going to have their hands full. But vigilance is every citizen s responsibility and by obeying the rules, only swimming in demarcated and monitored areas, and ensuring young children are constantly accounted for, we can all do our bit to keep the season a safe and sane one. Proactive measures are always welcome, which is why the police must be commended for this week deploying hundreds of rookie cops to beef up security at malls throughout the province. Tis the season to be merry by all means, but we should also pause to exercise caution and help ease the enormous pressure placed on those who will be working around the clock to save lives. It s the least we can all do. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
