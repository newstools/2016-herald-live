Buzz Aldrin at the South Pole Picture: Christina Korp / Twitter Moonwalker and space exploration advocate Buzz Aldrin is recovering in hospital with fluid in his lungs after being hastily evacuated by air from the South Pole. The 86-year-old former astronaut famous for being the second man to set foot on the moon in 1969 flew as part of a tourist group to the remote frozen continent this week from Cape Town. But his condition deteriorated and an urgent appeal was made to the National Science Foundation (NSF) which manages the US Antarctic Program to carry out an emergency medical evacuation. Tour operator White Desert which had hosted Aldrin on the trip said in a statement that the evacuation was carried out successfully and that he had been admitted to a hospital in New Zealand. He currently has fluid in his lungs but is responding well to antibiotics and is being kept overnight for observation. His condition is stable and his manager who is currently with him described him being in good spirits it said. After a gruelling 24 hours we re safe in New Zealand tweeted his manager Christina Korp. As @TheRealBuzz is recovering I did want to let people know that he did make it to the South Pole which was his objective. Thnx for prayers she added along with photographs of him walking on the ice.
