KEEP TRADITION: Mayor Athol Trollip and his deputy, Mongameli Bobani, talk to the initiates in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage. Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI Trollip visits circumcision schools to inspect conditions following death Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality plans to demarcate areas in and around the city so that the traditional Xhosa circumcision and initiation into manhood can be carried out in a safe environment. This is according to mayor Athol Trollip, who visited initiation schools in Motherwell and Uitenhage yesterday. I am familiar with the custom. However, I feel it must be carried out in a suitable environment where people do not bring alcohol or drugs to the initiates, he said. Trollip s call for demarcated areas follows the death of Luphelo Madela, 19, who died of a suspected drug overdose in Kwa-Nobuhle earlier this week. The mayor was accompanied by his deputy, Mongameli Bobani, and a number of chiefs, who all had encouraging words for the initiates during the oversight visit. While Trollip said initiates looked healthy, he was concerned that some of their huts were next to an informal dumping site in Motherwell and a grave yard in Uitenhage. I am here to look at the conditions. We had a setback of an initiate who died here in an incident that is not related to initiation, he said. You are here because you have the blessing of your parents. Let us keep our tradition. We look up to you. An 18-year-old initiate, who declined to be named, said: We were not sure what to expect by his visit, but we are encouraged to get words of wisdom from our elders.
