Municipal dam levels will be published in The Herald from today in the hope that it will raise awareness of our water crisis. These figures will be carried in the paper on Tuesdays and Fridays. Any dam level below 50% capacity is considered critical. The Churchill Dam is at 46.86% while the Loerie Dam is sitting at 20.26%. The remaining dams are above 50%. Infrastructure, engineering and electricity political head Annette Lovemore said the Loerie Dam was a balancing dam between the Kouga Dam and Loerie water treatment works. Its volume is not as crucial as the others because we top up as we need from the Kouga Dam, she said. It does become critical when we reach our abstraction limit from the Kouga Dam, but, for the most part, it is not considered as critical as the others when it is low. This past weekend saw 8.1mm rainfall at the Loerie Dam, 5.3mm at the Churchill Dam and 10.8mm at the Impofu Dam. We are very grateful for the rain over the weekend, Lovemore said. The Churchill and the Kouga dams are still at less than 50% of their capacity, which is worrying. As long as we have dams below 50%, the threat of water-shedding hangs strongly over our heads. We are very anxious about this. Residents are urged to check their water meters regularly and aim to use no more than 250l a day per household. Meanwhile, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality will disconnect the water supply to NU2, NU3, Markman, Wells Estate and Ikamvelihle from 8am to 4pm today as a zonal water meter will be installed. A zonal water meter is a smart system that enables the municipality to improve water-resource management and leak detection. Report water leaks to 0800-205-050.
