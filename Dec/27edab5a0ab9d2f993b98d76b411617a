The general manager at Founders Lodge, Vicky Nel, shared this simple recipe for the best cheesecake recipe ever . Weekend Post tasted it at high tea and we concur! Founders Lodge cheesecake Start by preparing a standard base by mixing crushed Tennis biscuits with just enough butter to bind it. Press the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan; bake for 10 minutes and cool down. In the meantime prepare the filling. Mix together 115g of castor sugar and 3 tablespoons of Maizena until smooth. Now add 750g cream cheese and blend in a blender until smooth and creamy. Add 3 large eggs and blend well. Add 500ml thick, fresh cream and blend in. Now add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract OR the inside of 1 vanilla pod along with the zest of one lemon and one orange. Blend everything together well and pour into the base. Bake for 40 minutes in a hot oven if it gets too brown cover it with foil. Let the cheesecake cool to room temperature, then place in the fridge for an hour or so before serving with fruit coulis. Click here to read more on Founders Lodge.
