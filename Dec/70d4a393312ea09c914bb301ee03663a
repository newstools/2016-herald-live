MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Luke Palframan (red top) after the rescue Picture: Supplied One of Port Elizabeth s youngest lifesaver volunteers helped save a swimmer at Pollok Beach on Sunday. Luke Palframan, 17, who starts Grade 12 at Theodor Herzl next year, only has a year of lifesaving experience under his belt. But Luke who was off duty at the time said it was his priority to serve the community. Grant Breetzke, who trained Luke at Sardinia Bay, said he was impressed with the young lifesaver. I am really glad to see that his training just kicked in, Breetzke said. The [rescued] swimmer was checked out at hospital and he is doing fine. Luke said as soon as he realised the man was in trouble he just went into autopilot. It was Sunday afternoon just before 4pm. I was off duty. I was just swimming and body surfing in the waves. I saw a man start going under the waves. He started to struggle, Luke said. I could see he was a bit too deep. He couldn t stand. He tried to grab onto a person who swam near him. Then he went under for three seconds. When I saw this I knew this man was drowning. The lifeguards couldn t see him because there were so many people on the beach and in the sea. I signaled for a friend on the beach to bring a boogie board. Another friend came to help. The three of us brought him to the beach and dragged him onto the sand, he said. I think if we were there 10 seconds later he would have lost consciousness. He was in deep trouble. We put him in the recovery position so that he could breath and vomit up water. He was doing better when I left. Luke said he left to seek treatment as he hurt his own hand in the process. I don t even know who he is. I am very grateful that I got to save a life. As I was leaving the ambulance arrived. Luke started lifesaving at Sardinia Bay Lifesavers Club in October last year. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
