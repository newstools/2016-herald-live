Mod Ndoyana Picture: Judy de Vega Almost 18 months since he was suspended, Nelson Mandela Bay&#8217;s corporate services boss Mod Ndoyana was fired on Tuesday. It follows a lengthy disciplinary process which started during former mayor Danny Jordaan&#8217;s term. Ndoyana was accused of various irregularities, gross negligence and violations of municipal law. The municipality&#8217;s portfolio head of corporate services, councillor Dean Biddulph, said Ndoyana&#8217;s dismissal opens up the position and allows the new administration to hire a &#8220;fresh face&#8221; into the critical post. &#8220;We commit to appointing a new Corporate Services Executive Director who will take this Metro forward through clean and principled governance. &#8220;This is the second high profile case that has been successfully prosecuted and includes the recent dismissal of supply chain management employee, Sox Nkanjeni,&#8221;Biddulph said. Nkanjeni previously told The Herald that he was fighting his dismissal. Biddulph said a senior budget and treasury official will appear before a disciplinary panel in January. The official is believed to be Nadia Gerwel. &#8220;Several high level suspensions have recently taken place and we aim to complete all outstanding investigations in 2017. &#8220;We intend to clean up the administration without fear or favour and remain on course to create a model of governance where accountability, honesty and professionalism become the hallmarks of a people-centred local government,&#8221; Attempts to reach Ndoyana for comment were unsuccessful.
