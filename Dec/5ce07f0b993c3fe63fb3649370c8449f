Nine traditional surgeons have been arrested for unlawful circumcision since the beginning of the summer initiation season. Traditional affairs provincial spokesman Mamnkeli Ngam said the surgeons were from various districts in the province. Ngam said the department was pleased with the action of parents who had decided to open cases after their sons were circumcised unlawfully and without their permission. We will see more arrests as there are more illegal initiation schools run by bogus traditional surgeons in the province, he said. Most of the arrested traditional surgeons were from King Sabata Dalindyebo municipal areas, which included Mthatha and Mqanduli. Of the nine, two were from Cacadu [formerly Lady Frere] and one from Tamarha village near King William s To w n , Ngam said. One of the traditional surgeons had already been convicted and sentenced, while the other eight were out on bail or warnings. Ngam said illegal initiation schools contributed to the problem of circumcising young boys, some only 11years old. According to law regulating traditional initiation, boys should be 18 or older before they undergo the rite. The traditional surgeon must also have written permission from their parents. Ngam said police had also opened19 inquest dockets in connection with the deaths of initiates. The death toll in the province stands at 24. In last year s summer season, 46 initiates died. We want traditional circumcision practitioners to account for each and every death. Nobody must kill initiates and escape arrest, Ngam said. &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
