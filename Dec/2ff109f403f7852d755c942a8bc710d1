Emma Maske at the Plett Rage registration Picture: Ewald Stander For the next week Plettenberg Bay will be a playground for thousands of the country s matrics celebrating their new-found freedom at the 14th annual Plett Rage festival, which kicked off in the coastal town yesterday. Thousands of matrics are expected to flock to the festival one of the biggest events of its kind in the southern hemisphere until next Friday. Plett Rage has become synonymous with partying, fun in the sun and some of South Africa s top music performances. It has also become one of the town s biggest economic injections, bringing in approximately R50-million over the eight-day period. And this year expectations are no different. We anticipate about 12 000 students to make their way to Plett over the coming week and we estimate that on average a student will spend about R10 000. This will be on accommodation, food, drink and area activities. This not only starts our summer season, it also encourages additional employment in both the retail and tourism industries, Plett Tourism spokeswoman Patty Butterworth said.
