UNDER WAY: Hundreds of ANC, EFF and other party supporters march to the City Hall yesterday to hand over a petition to mayor Athol Trollip. Picture: JUDY DE VEGA ANC leads protest action, calls DA-led coalition a corrupt government of thieves targeting the poor Hundreds of Nelson Mandela Bay residents converged on the Wool Exchange building yesterday, demanding that mayor Athol Trollip receive their petition against electricity and water cuts. Led by the ANC and its affiliates, more than 600 marchers including EFF, UDM and COPE supporters walked from the show grounds in Sidwell to Military Road. Addressing the crowd at the City Hall, where they had initially planned to deliver the petition, march coordinator and ANC regional task team convener Vuyani Limba said the march was to inform the municipality that black people could not continue living with electricity and water cuts. The petition accuses the DA-led coalition of corruption, failure to deal with the stagnant bus system, racism, and a purge of officials aligned to the ANC, specifically Kupido Baron. Limba said Trollip had been given 14 days to respond or residents would engage in rolling mass action which might make the city ungovernable. The DA coalition has brought more misery and pain inside and outside the municipality, with more nepotism and corruption violating the basic principles of developmental local government, Limba said. ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the party did not agree with the coalition government as it did not consider the plight of poor people.
