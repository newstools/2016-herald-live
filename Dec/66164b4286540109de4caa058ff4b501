SEEKING VICTORY: Chippa United captain James Okwuosa says his team have to up their game Picture: GALLO IMAGES For the team to achieve their mandate in the Premier Soccer League this season, they need to start winning games, says Chippa United captain James Okwuosa. The Port Elizabeth side play Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in a league fixture at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium tomorrow (6pm). The Chilli Boys plan to finish higher than their previous top eight spot of last season in the league this time around. The only way to achieve that is simply by winning matches, which is something the team has been struggling to accomplish lately. Chippa will be desperately looking for a win against Amakhosi tomorrow to help the team get back to their winning form. A win against Chiefs will also be a major confidence boost for the players. We have been trying to improve in each and every game we play, Okwuosa said. The spirit in the group remains high. The league is a marathon but we also understand that we need to start collecting points, especially at home. We have set clear objectives of where we want to finish on the log and we need to start winning games in order to achieve our aim this season. The Nigerian defender also urged supporters to once again come in their numbers to the stadium and rally behind the team. Chippa have been without a win in their last seven matches, with the most recent result being a 1-1 draw against Maritzburg United on Tuesday night. The Chilli Boys winless streak in the latter part of the year has seen them drop further down the log to 11th position, with 10 points from 10 matches. Coach Dan Malesela s troops only have two wins in the bag this season, their most recent victory being a 4-1 win against Baroka FC. Tickets for the game are on sale at TicketPro outlets at R40 (adults) and R10 (schoolgoing children). Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
