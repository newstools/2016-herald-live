A painting of Thuli Madonsela in Rosedale Drive, Uitenhage Picture: Fredlin Adriaan He may not have captured the state, but a Port Elizabeth artist is capturing the imagination of those who admire the woman who relentlessly pursued and probed the issue. A dilapidated building in the middle of the veld in Uitenhage where cows often graze is turning out to be the centre of attraction for locals and passers-by who are greeted by the imposing countenance of former public protector Thuli Madonsela. Artist Buntu Fihla Titled My President, the large wall mural is visible to motorists driving down Maduna Road, KwaLanga, and the artist, Buntu Fihla, speaks fondly of the qualities and courage demonstrated by Madonsela. The mural, which was painted a few months ago on the abandoned building, symbolised gratitude to her and the rest of South Africa s mothers for their dedication and sacrifice, Fihla said. Madonsela is synonymous with many things uprightness, anti-corruption, bravery and integrity. This mural also celebrates the sacrifices made by all the mothers and I want to say thank you. Anything that has a mother s touch is dignified. Born in Mnqaba Village, King William s Town, Fihla, 35, said he had been inspired by the work of Madonsela, whom he has yet to meet in person. Asked how the idea had come about, Fihla who recently relocated to Port Elizabeth said: I needed to paint something unique that will have a lasting impact. When my cousin and I drove past that building, a thought of Madonsela quickly dropped in. She to me, she is like what Justin Bieber means to a 15-year-old. She is a heroine of mine, he said.
