If you are caught at a roadblock this festive season and you have outstanding fines, worry not Eastern Cape traffic officers will be ready for you to swipe your card and make your payment on the spot. Traffic officers will accept card payments from errant motorists caught on the road, the Eastern Cape Department of Transport said. After the card is swiped in a machine, motorists will get a message on their cellphones about the deduction. The money will go to the department on behalf of the treasury. The department said the machines were small, handy and easy to use. Transport spokesman Nkululeko Vellem said: The machines will be available at some of our major roadblocks around the Eastern Cape. But insufficient funds available in your account will result in an arrest. No cash will be accepted. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
