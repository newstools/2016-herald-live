With hordes of people expected to stream to the beaches on New Year s day, Eastern Cape health authorities have once again appealed to beach goers not to go into the water without the presence of lifeguards. The plea comes after a person had to be rescued from drowning at Bluewater Bay in Port Elizabeth on Boxing Day. Meanwhile, the body of a 10-year-old boy was recovered from the Umzimvubu River on the same day, after he drowned a few days before Christmas. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said it was worrying that most of the victims were children. If you look at the statistics, it is children between 10 and 12 years, he said. That shows that children are being allowed to go swimming without any adult supervision. He advised people not to go for a swim on the beach unless there were lifeguards around. The latest drowning brings to five the number reported in the Eastern Cape in the past two weeks. Last week, Times Media reported that three children had drowned. Among them was an eight-year-old girl who drowned at popular Second Beach in Port St Johns. Her 12-year-old friend survived and was taken to hospital. Kupelo said the drowning occurred shortly after lifeguards had knocked off duty for the day and gone home. Another bather, said to be a middle- aged man from Lusikisiki, is believed to have drowned at the same beach. Kupelo said a search-and-rescue mission to try and retrieve the body had since been called off. Two boys, aged seven, also drowned, one in East London and the other in Butter worth.
