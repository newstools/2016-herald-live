Chippa United s convincing win over Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend could prove the catalyst for a change in fortunes for the Eastern Cape club after a slump of eight matches without a win coach Dan Malesela said. I hope that this victory will bring winning ways back to the team Malesela said. We needed the motivation and now that there is a little break we can work positively. It gives us time to breathe and to reflect. To be able to reflect with a win behind your back is much better. We have to satisfy a lot of people especially the club our supporters and families. Malesela s side came from a goal down at half time to win 3-1 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium and move up one place in the Absa Premiership standings. It was only their third win in 11 games and came after the coach had given the players a dressing down at half time. He screamed at the players and suggested to them that they were seeking to get him fired. Malesela said he had also been hard on his players in training as he sought to get them to employ his passing style. I ve been insulting at training but I ve been trying to find the reason for why the players do things at training. In my view there must be a reason for the things you do when you shoot why you pass. But there are glimpses that we are getting there he said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
