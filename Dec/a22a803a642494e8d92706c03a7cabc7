Chippa United now have a month s break to recharge their batteries after losing 1-0 to Ajax Cape Town in their last Premier Soccer League fixture before the mid-season break. The defeat was the Port Elizabeth side s sixth this season. They are 11th on the log with 16 points from 14 games. Chippa have netted 14 goals and have conceded 12 goals so far in the league. They are only four points away from relegation. Coach Dan Malesela had hoped a win against Ajax could place Chippa in a favourable place on the log before the break. However, things did not go according to plan for Malesela. He will now use the break to try and find solutions to how he can get his charges back to their winning ways, before the second leg of their league campaign.
