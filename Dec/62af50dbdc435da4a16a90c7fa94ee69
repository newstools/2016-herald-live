The police have issued a warning to motorists to be vigilant when approaching intersections and T-junctions over the festive season. This comes after a woman was raped and her male companion stabbed several times after they were pulled out of a VW Polo at the Addo Road intersection on Friday afternoon. Five men attacked the 51-year-old woman and the 39-year-old man after their vehicle stopped at the R334 junction on their way to Uitenhage. Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said: The suspects allegedly forced the driver into the boot of the car and then drove into the nearby bushes where the [woman] was repeatedly raped and the man stabbed several times in the upper body. Before the suspects fled with the vehicle, both the victims were tied and left in the bushes. The victims managed to untie themselves and sought help. A case of rape and hijacking is being investigated. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
