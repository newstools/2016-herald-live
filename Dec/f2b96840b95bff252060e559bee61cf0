This comes as the prevalence of the infection and syndrome has decreased dramatically in other districts in the Eastern Cape. These revelations were made by wellness specialist Dr Margo de Koker at a World Aids Day commemoration at the Feather Market Centre yesterday. World Aids Day is held on December 1 each year and is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in the fight against HIV, show their support for people living with HIV, and to commemorate people who have died De Koker said the hotspot status could be attributed to risky lifestyle choices in the city. The thinking is that in the population of young women, we know that they consume more alcohol than they did previously. There is also the issue of sex for money, as many women have turned to sugar daddies, she said. This is an adverse group . . . as women can be more manipulated and forced into unprotected sex.
