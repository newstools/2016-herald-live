Jamaican track superstar Usain Bolt plans to concentrate on the 100m next season, his last in a glorious career which saw him capture nine Olympic gold medals. Right now, I have to just go out there and enjoy it, Bolt said. I think we have done the bulk of the work over the 10 years we have been working, so now I will just be trying to enjoy the season, not too much stress, he said. Bolt, 30, dominated the sprint events over an unprecedented span of years, winning the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay at three consecutive Olympic Games. He also holds the 100m record (9.58sec) and the 200m (19.19), and has won 11 world titles. But he will compete in plenty of track meets. It s all about my fans. I am just going out there for them and do my best as always. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
