Police have found 252 of the 360 safety deposit boxes which were stolen from the Randburg branch of First National Bank in a brazen heist a week before Christmas. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Ndivhuwo Malamu said the boxes which had been forcibly opened were found on a mine dump near the FNB Stadium in Soweto on Tuesday last week two days after the heist on December 18. There was no sign of any of the jewellery or Kruger Rands which the victims have said they entrusted to the boxes rented at a cost of several hundred rands a month but many documents were recovered. The thieves tied up the lone security guard on duty at the bank and then spent at least 12 hours gaining access to the safety deposit box section with a jackhammer before loading the boxes into a van. The small print of the bank s safety deposit box contract states that it will not be legally responsible under any circumstances for any loss or damage that may occur to the contents , but the victims have questioned whether the bank took appropriate steps to secure the area. Asked why FNB had not informed the victims that the opened abandoned boxes were discovered early last week the bank s chief executive of FNB Points of Presence, Lee-Anne van Zyl, only repeated the statement she gave last week. FNB can confirm it is working closely with SAPS and in light of the pending investigation is unable to provide further details of the robbery, she said.
