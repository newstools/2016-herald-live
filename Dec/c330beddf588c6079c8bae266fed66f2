Nelson Mandela Bay is facing serious water restrictions and residents ignoring them could feel the cost reaching deep into their pockets if they are not careful. So Weekend Post went looking for some interesting ways to keep the water bills down and asked some of our readers how they would go about conserving water. First off, consider the following: the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality issued a statement asking residents to keep their daily water consumption at about 250l, or 7.5kl a month per household. But what can you do with 250l of water per day? Flushing your toilet once uses about 7l. The average shower uses 8l of water a minute, meaning that a five-minute shower uses up to 40l. If each member in a family of four takes one shower daily, and uses the toilet three times a day (assuming they flush every time they do), they have used up their daily quota. That leaves very little for cooking, washing clothes and dishes, washing hands and brushing teeth. The average bath takes up to 140l, so that is pretty much out of the question. Under normal conditions the average household uses up to 24kl a month (800l a day). With current restrictions in place, flushing your toilet will be 1c more expensive, and a five-minute shower could cost up to 5c more. That may sound ridiculous, but saving water actually saves money. So, how do we save water, and by extension, some money?
