Older white South Africans have become much more dependent on their younger counter parts. This is according to a report just released by the Institute for Race Relations. Institute analyst Gerbrandt van Heerden said: Looking at the extent to which old people depend on the young for the African population such dependency levels have declined while for whites they have increased sharply. The research found that the African population was the only one in the country in which old depending on young had decreased. In 2003 for every 100 employed African people there were 21 people over 65 depending on them for support. In 2004 the figure dipped dramatically to 15 and since then it has moved up or down by just a few points. This year it was 16. For the coloured population it went up. In 2003 for every 100 employed people 12 over 65 relied on them for support. This year it was at 15.For the Indian/Asian population it went up from 14 in 2003 to 21 this year. But by far the biggest increase was among whites. In 2003 for every 100 employed white people 24 depended on them just under a quarter. By this year, the figure had gone up to an unprecedented 38. The African population is the only race group in which the proportion of the economically inactive exceeds that of the employed by nearly 154%.
