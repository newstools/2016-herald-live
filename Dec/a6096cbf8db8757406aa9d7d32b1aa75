Chippa United s late goal during their 1-1 draw against Maritzburg United in a Premier Soccer League fixture on Tuesday night has given coach Dan Malesela hope that a win is on the way. The draw was Chippa s fourth in the league this season. The Chilli Boys have recorded only two wins so far, which came earlier in the campaign. Chippa s winless streak in the latter part of the year has seen them drop to 10th place on the log with 10 points from 10 matches. Speaking at a media conference at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium yesterday, Malesela said Tuesday s game was OK . It s that same story of conceding one and missing a lot [of goals]. The only difference here is that at least we scored one and that says something, he said. So long as we are creating it says that there is a possibility we will score and win matches. Malesela said the point collected away would, hopefully, have given the team a lift after three consecutive defeats. However, a win against Kaizer Chiefs at the Bay stadium on Saturday would be a massive boost for the struggling Port Elizabeth team. We got a point [against Maritzburg] and we can get some confidence out of that, he said. Three points will be even better and will boost us very much, he said. Plus, we have a bit of a break after our game on Saturday until we play Polokwane [City on December 14]. He said a win against Chiefs would also help them relax before the Polokwane fixture.
