Former Proteas cricketers Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock, Lance Klusenere, Jacques Kallis and Rudi Bryson Picture: Facebook Rudi Bryson accused of scamming thousands from clients &nbsp; Branded a deviant liar by clients, former Proteas cricket player Rudi Bryson has allegedly fleeced friends of hundreds of thousands of rands in a number of scams. The alleged scams include pocketing money for tickets to the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City, selling fake concert tickets, taking money for a corporate function without making the booking, and not delivering paid-for tickets. The cricketer, who in the 1990s played a number of one-day internationals, also played for Eastern Province. This week, a former friend, Plettenberg Bay businessman Duncan Brown, accused Bryson, 48, of stealing R75 000 when he booked tickets and accommodation through Bryson s events company, RB Hospitality for the Nedbank Golf Challenge. Brown says he was shocked to discover that Bryson had not bought tickets or accommodation simply pocketing the money. Brown said he had received a message while driving to Port Elizabeth to catch his flight, explaining that the accommodation had been cancelled as final payment had not been made. Bryson blamed a woman in his office for the mistake. The golf event took place last month and Brown has been trying for a refund ever since. Fed up with endless WhatsApp messages promising payment, Brown this week went public with his allegations on Facebook. A flurry of accusations followed from others who claimed Bryson had done them in too. Friendships spanning decades are now in tatters as former cricket colleagues and friends try to get their money.
