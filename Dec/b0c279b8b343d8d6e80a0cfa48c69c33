Drive to curb expenses heats up as phone, fuel, aircon spending cut Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip has upped the ante and raised his municipal cost-saving initiative to R150-million by vowing to cut down on stationery, furniture, petrol and even the municipality s air-conditioning bill. Trollip vowed to secure R100-million in financial savings within his first 100 days in office earlier this year. His first 100 days in office ended on Saturday. At a media conference today, Trollip will announce what goals he achieved in his administration s first 100 days. Budget and treasury political head Retief Odendaal said yesterday Trollip s cost-saving initiative had been increased toR150-million after noticing a trend of luxury spending in the operational budget. If the fiscal cuts are approved by the council today, the new amounts will be factored into the municipal adjustments budget. Odendaal said the budget cuts would not affect service delivery. The mayor s brief was to go and look at the operational budget. He wanted us to look at line items that were overinflated and bloated. He wanted to identify a saving ofR100-million on the condition that those savings would not affect service delivery, Odendaal said.
