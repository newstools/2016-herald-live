The rand was firmer at midday on Thursday but off intraday best levels as the local currency showed muted reaction to the possible inflationary consequences of higher oil prices. A range of local and global issues is expected to keep the local currency on the back foot in December. These include S&amp;P Global s ratings announcement on Friday as well as the US Federal Reserve s interest rate decision in the middle of December. Higher oil prices could cause the Reserve Bank to re-examine its interest rate stance. Although the monetary policy committee at its last meeting indicated that the rate hiking cycle appeared to be nearing its end it did not exclude further rate hikes in 2017 which would be dependant on global and economic developments. Brent crude was up 0.96% to $51.91 a barrel in late morning trade after spiking 7% on Wednesday after members of the oil cartel Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to implement production cuts to boost prices. The rand firmed to R13.9385 against the dollar in intraday trade on a slightly weaker dollar but could not hold on to those firmer levels. At 11.32am it was at R14.0528 against the dollar from R14.1027. It was at R14.9152 against the euro from a previous R14.9298 and at R17.5955 against the British pound from R17.6366. The euro was at $1.0614 from $1.0587. The rand weakened to R14.16 to the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the cartel s decision. The rand was under pressure from renewed comments by Fed members that a US interest rate hike was approaching sooner than later . The dollar is expected to strengthen if the Austrian presidential election on Sunday as well as the Italian referendum on constitutional reform pointed to further populist support on the continent. News concerning Italy s upcoming referendum seems to be negatively weighing on the euro analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said. The local currency also found no favour as South African trade data on Wednesday disappointed Nedbank said. &#8211; TMG Digital/BusinessLive Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
