Health MEC Dr Phumza Dyantyi has demanded that patients staying at the Lorraine and Algoa frail care centres be medically examined and admitted to hospital, if necessary, before being moved from the two Port Elizabeth facilities. The frail care centres are due to close on December 31. We are not going to allow what happened in Gauteng to happen here, health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said. In Gauteng, 36 psychiatric patients died after being moved from a Life Esidimeni centre this year. Kupelo said the department was finalising a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Social Development. We will provide healthcare to the residents once they are moved, he said. But we are making it very clear in this document that we will not take over the day-to-day care of these patients. That is the Department of Social Development s job.
