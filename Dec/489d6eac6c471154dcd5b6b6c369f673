Tension between the SA Revenue Service (SARS) and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan mounted yesterday, with the tax agency issuing a statement in which it noted with dismay the unjustified accusation that its leadership lacked accountability. Gordhan made the comment earlier this week in his reply to a parliamentary question by DA finance spokesman David Maynier. SARS informed Gordhan for the purpose of his reply to Maynier that it did not have a specialized investigating unit similar to the covert rogue unit which has caused such a controversy over the past year. The existence of this unit when Gordhan was the SARS commissioner led to his being hounded by the Hawks. However following an expos by the Sunday Times last month, subsequent to its submission of the information to the finance ministry SARS admitted that it had established a secret unit to investigate corrupt dealings between members of staff and individuals in the tobacco industry. SARS said yesterday its management did not lack accountability. It noted that since Gordhan had taken office in December last year, the SARS leadership had received 29 parliamentary questions from the finance minister s office. All parliamentary questions were responded to timeously and no single deadline was missed. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
