Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality officials are calling for residents to stop non-essential water use immediately as some areas in the western parts of the Bay are out of drinking water. Demand from the system has resulted in abstracting too much water from the Loerie and Kouga dams but, according to municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mnik, at this rate we will empty Loerie . This actually means that all non essential water use must be stopped immediately. Residents are requested to use water to drink, cook, wash in their basins and only to flush toilets when absolutely necessary, Mniki said. No household should use more than 250 litres of water a day right now. The affected areas are Rowallan Park, Lorraine, Kabega Park, Baywest and KwaNobuhle.
