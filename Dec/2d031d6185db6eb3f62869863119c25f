Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) has finalised proposals for a new mobile parking system to replace coin-operated meters Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI Business owners say planned new meters will chase customers away The new mobile parking system mooted by the Mandela Bay Development Agency will destroy the vibrant strip of eateries in Richmond Hill, according to Stanley Street restaurant owners. Motorists will have to fork out R5 an hour to park in many parts of the central area of Port Elizabeth if the system is approved. The MBDA has finalised proposals for the new system, which will go to the council next year for it to decide if it should be rolled out. The new system will replace older coin-operated meters, which charge R1 for 20 minutes. But many streets that could see the new system being used do not have the coin-operated meters. Angelo s day-shift manager Melissa Samuels said the new system would kill the business. People will not want to pay R5 for parking for one hour here, she said. It would also add an unnecessary financial burden on the restaurant s staff. It is an inconvenience for everybody, she said. Fushin s Jacques Jooste questioned the reasoning behind the new system, saying the car guards on the street were already doing a great job. We have car guards who have been here for seven years, he said.
