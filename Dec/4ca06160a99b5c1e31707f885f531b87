Taps are flowing again in Port Elizabeth s western suburbs and Uitenhage s KwaNobuhle, but residents across the city are urged to still keep their water usage down. An additional supply of water from the Loerie Dam was made available yesterday to stop the shortage that started on Thursday after the Chelsea reservoir ran dry. But Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality chief of staff Kristoff Adelbert said the supply at the Church and Loerie dams remained at risk of running dry. The new supply was only possible because yesterday was the first of the new month and [the Department of Water and Sanitation] started releasing water for December. This means residents used more water than was allocated and available for the month of November. The average dam levels are at 64%, but the critical ones are Church at 49% and Loerie at 20%, Adelbert said. The only sustainable plan is for residents to reduce water usage. The municipality is extremely concerned about this situation because come Christmas day we might be without water again.
