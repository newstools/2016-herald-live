INJURY BLOW: Ruan Combrinck Picture: GALLO IMAGES The Lions Super Rugby campaign for next year has already suffered a setback with the news that wing Ruan Combrinck will miss at least the opening five weeks of the tournament. Combrinck 26 underwent shoulder surgery on Wednesday after suffering a fracture while playing for the Springboks against Wales in Cardiff last Saturday. The Boks lost 27-13. The Golden Lions Rugby Union confirmed that Combrinck would be out for four months which means that if he has no unforeseen setbacks the earliest he is likely to feature in Super Rugby is next April. Combrinck is set to miss matches against the Cheetahs (Bloemfontein February 25) Waratahs (Ellis Park Match 4) Jaguares (Buenos Aires March 11) Reds (Ellis Park March 18) and Kings (Port Elizabeth March 25). It is the second serious injury sustained this year by the talented wing. Combrinck fractured a leg against Argentina in Buenos Aires earlier in the season as well.
