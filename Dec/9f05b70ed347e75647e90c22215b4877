STEPPING OUT: A pilot controls a walking robot Method-2 during a demonstration in Gunpo, South Korea, yesterday. Picture: REUTERS A giant South Korean-built manned robot that walks like a human but makes the ground shake under its weight has taken its first baby steps. Designed by a veteran of science fiction blockbusters, the four-metre &#8211; tall, 1.5-ton Method-2 towers over a room on the outskirts of Seoul. The hulking human-like creation bears a striking resemblance to the military robots starring in the movie Avatar. It is claimed as a world first by its creators at Hankook Mirae Technology, a South Korean robotics company, where about 30 engineers were hard at work conducting initial tests yesterday. Our robot is the world s first manned bipedal robot and is built to work in extreme hazardous areas where humans cannot go [unprotected], company chairman Yang Jin-Ho said. A pilot sitting inside the robot s torso makes limb movementswhich are mimicked by Method-2,whose metal arms each weigh 130 kilograms. The robot, more than twice the size of a tall man, is so heavy that it shakes the ground when it takes a step. Yang, who dreamed as a child of building his own robot, said he has invested 242 billion won (R27.9-billion) in the project since 2014 to bring to life what only seemed possible in movies and cartoons. Building the giant robot was a challenge for the engineers as its unprecedented scale meant they had nothing to refer to, said one who declined to be named. So far, it remains unclear how the robot will be used. Method-2 is seen more as a test-bed for various technologies that will allow the creators to build any type and size of robot. While its enormous size has grabbed media attention, the creators of Method-2 say the project score achievement is the technology they developed and enhanced along the way. &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
