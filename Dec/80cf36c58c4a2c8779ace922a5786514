Steve Komphela had to be escorted of the field after the Kaizer Chiefs game against Chippa United in NMB Stadium Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI Kaizer Chiefs have pleaded with the ailing club s increasingly irate supporters to remain calm as pressure continues to mount on beleaguered coach Steve Komphela. Incensed Chiefs fans have demonstrated their frustration with Komphela by hurling missiles and directing abuse at the embattled coach after the club s recent matches. He has had to be escorted out of venues by police and security officials with an assortment of objects raining down from the stands. On Saturday, they damaged the players tunnel at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. Chiefs spokesman Vina Maphosa said the club was going through a rough patch, but pleaded for calm. These are difficult times, he said. We are also disappointed by the poor run of results. The behaviour of a section of the supporters [was] not what we want to see at our games. We know our supporters are used to winning, but we appeal to [them] to calm down. We understand their pain. We are down but not out. Chiefs are seventh on the PSL standings, having played 12 matches won four drawn five and lost three. They have not won a game since beating Ajax Cape Town 2-0 in October. That victory was followed by goalless draws against Orlando Pirates and Baroka FC a 1-2 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns 1-1 draws with SuperSport United and Cape Town City and Saturday s 1-3 loss to Chippa United. Chiefs remaining matches are against Bloemfontein Celtic (at home, December 14) Polokwane City (at home, December 18) and away to Golden Arrows on December 21.
