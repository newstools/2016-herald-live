Seven caught in Bay every day over festive season Seven motorists have been arrested every day over the past three weeks for drunk-driving on Nelson Mandela Bay roads. While municipal police and traffic officers have only arrested 27 drunk drivers over this period, SA Police Service members have made 144 arrests. A breakdown of figures shows that the police arrest more than six drunk drivers a day, while the municipality s tally is one a day. This emerged yesterday when the SAPS and Bay metro police and traffic services supplied drunk driving arrest figures for the festive season. Joint figures from December 8 to Wednesday this week reveal that 171 alleged drunk drivers were arrested in the metro. Yesterday, 11 traffic officers were on duty in the metro area seven on the beachfront and surrounds, and four in other parts of the metro. Newly appointed metro police chief Yolanda Faro said that while only 27 arrests for drunk-driving had been made over the three-week period by municipal officials, a total of R500 000 in fines had been issued. Faro, who was appointed on December 1, said her main focus was visible policing at hot-spot areas.
