Conrad Gallagher Picture: Ruvan Boshoff Having allegedly whipped up a distasteful recipe of unpaid bills, Irish celebrity chef Conrad Gallagher, who recently opened up one of Port Elizabeth s priciest new restaurants, was forced to close his doors earlier this week after being evicted. The international chef and owner of Gallagher s on Stanley in Stanley Street, Richmond Hill, was accused of non-payment last month by several food suppliers in the Bay and was served an eviction order on Monday by his landlords lawyers, Minde Schapiro &amp; Smith. Gallagher allegedly also left a string of unpaid suppliers in his wake when he moved from Cape Town. When contacted, Gallagher, said: Not interested, thank you. One of the Stanley on Bain building s landlords, who did not want to be named, put up a handwritten notice on the windows of the former tapas-style restaurant that read: Cleaved from the herd, prime space to let with a number attached. It has since been replaced with a To Let sign. While Gallagher was not present at his restaurant to receive the eviction warrant, locks were changed, restricting entrance to the restaurant, with all the contents and table settings still in place. Minde Schapiro &amp; Smith director Heinrich Crous declined to comment as legal action against the Michelin-star recipient is under way.
