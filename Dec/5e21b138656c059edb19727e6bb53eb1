Dwindling numbers and poor attendance at meetings have concerned parents of students divided over an appeal against NMMU. The parents failed last month in their legal bid to force NMMU to reopen its doors, discipline protesting students and implement more security structures on campuses and were planning to appeal against the ruling. However, with fewer than 20 parents attending last night s meeting at Verkenner Primary School, members of Concerned Association of Parents and Others for Tertiary Education at Universities (Captu) debated whether the matter was worth pursuing. As the legal fees grow, Captu committee members and their legal representatives urged parents to go on with the case before the new year. The legal fees, so far, total R200 000. Wheeldon, Rushmere and Cole senior director Brin Brody, who represents Captu, warned parents that if they threw in the towel now they would run the risk of forfeiting another appeal. In my view, the judgment was wrong. Judges can make mistakes that is why there are appeal courts, he said. At the first meeting held at the German Club in Lorraine on October 5, attended by more than 100 parents, the group was confident of the financial backing of 4 500 online signatories. NMMU spokeswoman Zandile Mbabela was unable to comment. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
