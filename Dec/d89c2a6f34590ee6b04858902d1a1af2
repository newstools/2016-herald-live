A planned fireworks display as part of New Year festivities has been ordered not to go ahead because of fears it could terrorise animals. The SPCA in Kempton Park in Gauteng went to court to halt the Ekurhuleni Municipality from having the fireworks as part of its New Year s Extravaganza. The National Council of SPCAs said the banning of the display would prevent the unnecessary and devastating suffering to animals within the area . Responding the municipality said it had noted residents concerns particularly a petition with more than 2 100 signatories. However spokesman Themba Gadebe said there had been no intention to have a fireworks display as the event had been incorrectly advertised. The city s joint organising committee (JOC) on December 21 2016 rejected a request for a fireworks display at Dries Niemandt Park on New Year s eve, Gadebe said. The rejection [of] a fireworks licence was based on the proximity to the residential area and flights passing to and from OR Tambo International Airport. By the time, the JOC decision came through Ekurhuleni had pre-programmed social media messages for the holiday period which included an announcement that there would be a fireworks display. The city withdraws this part of the statement and apologises for the confusion he said. Instead Gadebe said the committee had actually authorised a pyrotechnics display using lights and sound. Such systems were used at music festivals around major cities in South Africa. The sound level used would be below 90 decibels (dB), which was no louder than normal PA systems at events, while the lights used would vary from 9m to 45m in height. Fireworks on the other hand start from 120 dB and can reach heights between 180m and 200m Gadebe said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
