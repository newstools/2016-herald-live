Nine people have been arrested for attacking members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) on Christmas Day, leaving two officers in a critical condition in hospital. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela said the two officers were attacked with knives, stones and bottles in Dumba village near Tina Falls in Qumbu. The incident happened around midnight on Christmas Day after police were called by residents to attend to a crime. Instead it is alleged that on arrival the officers were attacked and held hostage inside a tavern, which prompted a call for more police to be sent to rescue their colleagues, Fatyela said. He said the backup policemen arrested nine people aged between 19 and 39. The attack also left a police vehicle damaged. Fatyela said the men would be charged with assault, obstructing the course of justice and malicious damage to property. He condemned the attack and said that criminals must know that such attacks would not deter the police from doing their work. The men will appear in the Qumbu Magistrate s Court today. In another incident, an ambulance responding to an emergency call in Mount Ayliff was pelted with stones by unknown people. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the ambulance s rear windshield was damaged during the attack. This is the second ambulance to be damaged within the last two weeks.
