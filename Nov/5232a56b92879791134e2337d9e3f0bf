Superheroes taking a stand against crime lit up the normally tedious Monday morning rush hour traffic yesterday as Spiderman and Batman enthusiastically stood their ground in 17th Avenue, Walmer. Sporting posters saying #CrimeMustFall, the two students are part of a YouTube video series being produced by Port Elizabeth comedian Roland Gaspar. The series poses the question: What if Spiderman or Batman were South African? Spiderman (Alex Karantges, 21) started off as a lone protester at about 7.30am holding the #CrimeMustFall placard. I think that is exactly what Spiderman would have done if he was South African, Gaspar said. After all, we believe that you can fight against anything by protesting. Karantges, who was joined later by Batman (Neil du Toit, 21), said he was very excited by the protest. People loved it. They were hooting and shouting encouragement and support, he said. It was awesome. One guy shouted that we must go protest at the university. Karantges saved for 10 years to import his lifelike Spiderman suit from the US. I think they told him he could be anything and he chose to be Spiderman, Gaspar said, laughing. Du Toit said: I am delighted that I got to be Batman because, in all honesty, who doesn t like to be Batman? Gaspar said he hoped to release the two videos showing Batman and Spiderman s South African adventures by the end of the month. It will be available on YouTube, he said. The video would detail the two superheroes adventures as they take a lighthearted look at real South African issues like #FeesMustFall, crime, current affairs and some situations involving minibus taxis. Have you ever wondered what it would be like if Spiderman s real name was Pieter Potgieter? Gaspar asked. Or if Batman lived in Port Elizabeth but had his roots in Bloemfontein?
