CLEVER COOK: Jenny Cape, who carefully cooked all the meals Tashnay Memphies needed in the isolation ward When doctors were planning the first paediatric stemcell transplant in the Eastern Cape, they faced a huge problem. While patient Tashnay Memphies, 6, and her mother, Natasha, were confined to an isolation room at the Port Elizabeth Provincial Hospital they would not be able to eat hospital food. It was here that Jenny Cape, a former chef and now volunteer counsellor at the hospital s paediatric oncology unit, stepped in. I said, well, I used to cook for a living. I will do it, Cape said. Following guidelines from a dietician, Cape sterilised her kitchen several times and started cooking the 180 meals Tashnay and her mom would need. It was an absolute privilege to do it, Cape said. Tashnay, of Schauderville, was diagnosed with leukaemia, which did not respond well to chemotherapy. A bone marrow transplant was her only option and doctors were fast running out of time. When the head of the department of paediatric oncology, Dr Johani Vermeulen, discovered that Tashnay s brother Jermaine, 10, was a perfect match for her, they decided they would attempt the first stemcell transplant on a child in the Eastern Cape.
