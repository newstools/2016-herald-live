Allow more emerging contractors to benefit from road construction projects, Nelson Mandela Bay councillors urged yesterday. They were unhappy to heart hat only four emerging companies were involved in the construction of gravel roads projects that are spread across 40 wards in the Bay. The four companies are Uhambiso, Iliso, Mzansi Civils and LA Consulting. The contractors are appointed under Izizwe Consulting Engineers which oversees the implementation of the project. The city has a three-year contract with the companies for there surfacing and tarring of gravel roads in 40 wards. At a roads and transport committee meeting yesterday, DA councillor Morne Steyn said the tender process had to be reviewed. The triennial tender is a thorny issue in any institution, he said. I believe that we need to review and relook how tenders are awarded and this should be done as a matter of urgency. ANC councillor Mbulelo Gidane said the big companies which had worked with the metro were continuously benefiting. We don t see our emerging microenterprises (EMEs), Gidane said. The tenders need to be unbundled to benefit our EMEs. It is not appetising to have the same, usual companies getting tenders.
