Backed by ward councilor support, the Ward 60 Coastal Business Forum is expected to play a pivotal role in developing entrepreneurship and facilitating the development of the area s economy. It will also lobby the local authority for administrative assistance and other needs towards establishing a Wells Estate economy. The forum believes it is blazing a new trail by being the country s first ward-based business forum. The organisation is firmly focused on the SMME sector. Yesterday, the forum presented its constitution, which not only formalises the organization but differentiates it from other business groupings, at the Wells Estate Community Hall. The forum is being led by chairman, the Rev Wandile Mhlaba, who is involved in the construction industry, and deputy chairman Stix Ralo, who is involved in the same industry. Organisations invited to attend the event included the Coega Development Corporation, the National Youth Development Agency and Nafcoc, among others.
