MOTOR MANIAC: Bay Illustrator Clive Botha, now a full member of the British Guild of Motoring Artists, at his drawing table Picture: Supplied A Port Elizabeth graphic designer s love of cars and passion for art has landed him a spot in one of the most exclusive motoring art clubs in the world. Following an intensive application and judging process Clive Botha, 39, of South End, has been granted full membership to the British Guild of Motoring Artists. This organisation has brought motoring artists, designers and engineers from all over the world together to showcase their work and commitment to motoring subjects since 1986. I did a lot of research to find out if there was a similar organisation in South Africa, but the guild is the only one of its kind in the world, Botha said. Becoming a member is a massive honour. I am one of only two people in Africa that form part of the guild. Drawing as a young Port Elizabeth boy, Botha drew a lot of inspiration from cars as he grew up in the motor city of South Africa . His passion for art led him to study graphic design at the Port Elizabeth Technikon, now part of NMMU.
