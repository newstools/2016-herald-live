SOLEMN PARADE: The Algoa Caledonian Pipe Band lead a Remembrance Day procession to the cenotaph in front of the Walmer Town Hall yesterday for a wreath-laying ceremony in honour of soldiers who died in the line of duty Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI About 200 Port Elizabeth residents yesterday remembered the fallen heroes, who died in the line of duty, at an annual Remembrance Day event. Held at the Aloe Moth Shellhole hall in Walmer, the event started with a street parade from Clarendon Park Primary School to the Walmer War Memorial where army veterans and Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani laid wreaths in honour of the men and women who died during World War I. One of the event organisers, Noel Smith, 66, who was in the South African Defence Force for 13 years said: We honour them on the Sunday closest to November 11 and it s to remember fallen comrades in all wars, not just here in South Africa. And it s to remember those who are still fighting for our freedom and looking after our country, giving gratitude for their role in keeping our country safe. Remembrance Day, or Remembrance Sunday, is a memorial day observed in Commonwealth countries to remember the sacrifices of members of the armed forces and civilians in times of war.
