Draft deal gives taxi bodies more control in project A new agreement to implement the Integrated Public Transport System in Nelson Mandela Bay has been drafted and could see taxi associations given more control of the troubled project. The municipality plans on signing a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with 11 taxi associations and the Algoa Bus Company. Laphum ilanga was brought in years ago to act as a cooperative body for the various associations, but this could now depend on the associations. The MOA was tabled at a transport committee meeting yesterday. ANC councillors criticised it, saying it would anger the taxi industry and bring the city to a standstill. ANC councillor Ncediso Captain said the DA-led coalition could not just throw away the old agreement without actually learning from it. We are not representing ourselves here but our communities, he said. This issue is going to affect the communities when the taxi associations don t agree with this new MOA there will be a problem. The issue caused a heated debate, with Captain calling for a strategic workshop with the associations before the MOA was approved. Committee chairman Rano Kayser said there was no agreement in place with the municipality and the various associations, and a workshop had been held.
