The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has lashed out at its suspended chairman Marius Fransman accusing him of being a counter-revolutionary undermining party structures and attacking secretary-general Gwede Mantashe. Fransman was suspended from the ANC for five years earlier this month by the party s national disciplinary committee. He was charged with misconduct for allegedly abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements &#8220;which brought the ANC into disrepute&#8221;. At a press conference in Cape Town on Tuesday acting provincial chairman Khaya Magaxa said that Fransman had undermined the work of the party s integrity commission which recommended that he face disciplinary action. &#8220;Attacking organisational mechanisms and tools in public clearly suggested he is no longer respecting the ANC &#8221; said Magaxa. During the DC and shortly after its final decision Fransman had blamed Mantashe for his woes alleging that he was a liar who protected a faction opposed to him in the province in exchange of their support for his ambition of becoming the party s deputy president. &#8220;It seems now it is becoming a subculture among corrupt and reactionary elements that lack organisational discipline and class consciousness to use the ANC secretary-general as their punching bag in order to convince factional lords of their loyalty &#8221; said Magaxa. Fransman is close to the so called &#8220;Premier League&#8221; faction in the ANC which includes the premiers of the Free State Premier Ace Magashule North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo and Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza. The grouping is said to be pushing for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to succeed President Jacob Zuma as the party s number one. Magaxa said Fransman had to stop creating imaginary scapegoats and take responsibility for his actions. &#8220;It is extremely reckless disrespectful and mischievous for comrade Marius to draw the SG of the ANC into his indiscretions and misdemeanors &#8221; he said. He also slammed him for keeping mum when members of the Congress of South African Students occupied the provincial office last week demanding the return of Fransman. &#8220;There is no way we can keep quiet when kids who are supposed to be preparing for school exams are asked to camp in the offices of the ANC and to disrupt it from doing its work &#8221; said Magaxa. He said the party viewed the act as an &#8220;exploitation of the vulnerability of malleable youth&#8221; and an attempt by Fransman to run away from justice.
