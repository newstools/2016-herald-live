Cooperative Governance MEC Fikile Xasa urged Nelson Mandela Bay councilors yesterday to stop bickering and rather serve their communities. Xasa said this after ANC councilors Andile Mfunda, Xola Sabani and Litho Suka complained that the DA-led coalition was not respecting their ward councilors when conducting public meetings. The meetings have seen friction between the ANC and DA since Integrated Development Plan and budget meetings started in the city. Several meetings have been disrupted since a six-week programme was started by the new coalition government to visit wards to listen to residents needs. This regime must respect our councillors, Mfunda said. Ward councillors are the chairpersons of wards and must be involved in things happening in their wards. Xasa said he had sensed there was political bickering among councillors. Politics must not impact on serving the people, he said. All councillors must rise to the occasion and serve communities. Maybe you can learn from each other how to be an opposition or to lead. He said he would be back in two weeks to discuss the political situation with councillors.
