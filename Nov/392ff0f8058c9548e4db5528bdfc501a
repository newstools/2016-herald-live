What is the point of listing all the municipal customer care offices with telephone numbers on the website? I tried to contact them telephonically all day intermittently from 8.30am to 3pm Walmer, Uitenhage, Cleary Park, Govan Mbeki and Korsten. Govan Mbeki is constantly engaged and at the others the phones just ring and ring and ring. Are the phones out of order, is there no telephonist to answer or do we just not care? I want to make enquiries regarding the payment of a deposit for water, etc. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
