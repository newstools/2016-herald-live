HANGING OUT: Delphine Lechifflart performs at the Port Elizabeth harbour Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN French couple s dockside show enthralls crowds at yacht club Reminiscent of a Charlie Chaplin classic, a French acrobatic duo wowed audiences with their unique display of silent comedy and romantic skits aboard their sailboat, La Loupiote, while at anchor in front of the Algoa Bay Yacht Club in the Port Elizabeth Harbour at the weekend. Acrobats Delphine Lechifflart, 46, and Franck Rabilier, 48, have sailed all around the world where they have showcased their unique circusnavigating to audiences in Australia, Paris and Morocco, among many countries. The duo relies on donations received during their performance to fund the continuation of their voyage. The first show, titled The Sailor, pokes fun at the mishaps of clumsy skippers who try to manoeuvre their way around the sailboat while showcasing their acrobatic abilities. The second, titled Between Wing and Island, sketches the romantic and humorous aspects of the male-female relationship in a poetic spectacle of aerial choreography. After 12 years aboard their eye-catching, bright yellow vessel, the performers brought their two-part show to the Bay s shores after recently sailing from Richards Bay. Having delivered their last performances yesterday, they plan to spend some more time in the Nelson Mandela Bay region, before, weather permitting, they make their way to Simonstown.
