 Disgusting and devilish is how Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has described a fake Facebook account that has him hot under the collar. His office said yesterday the account used Nhleko s full names and feautured the minister s individual pictures and others taken with SAPS members. I categorically distance myself from the Facebook account and regard the fraudulent use of my name and pictures as a serious violation of my rights, the minister said. This act must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. The act is utterly disgusting and devilish. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
