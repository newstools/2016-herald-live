Do you have a story you have always wanted to tell? Bay residents will get the opportunity to do so by joining a new creative innovation circle that will culminate in a series of workshops early next year. The Buy Our Work (Bow) Creative Innovation Incubator Circle will officially kick off at Old Grey Club on February 1, ending before Easter. This will be followed by an assessment after Easter, and an awards presentation on May 1. There will be two introduction sessions about the project in the boardroom at Old Grey Club this month and anyone who is interested in taking part next year, will need to attend one of the two sessions. The first introductory session will be at the club on Wednesday at 10am, 3pm and 6pm. The next session is on Wednesday November 30, also at 10am, 3pm and 6pm in the boardroom venue. Three themed workshops are planned for next year and each will run over a day, from 9am to 4pm. The main requirements to participate in the Circle are: a love of words; a good dictionary; a commitment to see value in the time invested. The main outcome is that the participant will know if he or she has the potential to be a creative wordsmith. The driving force behind the Bow Creative Innovation Incubator Circle, Mike Lenaghan, is a veteran media person and an existing director of the Press Council of South Africa. He has 10 full-length motion pictures to his credit, including having worked on Clint Eastwood s Invictus. Bow Enterprise was established in 2010 when Lenaghan returned to his birth city of Port Elizabeth.
