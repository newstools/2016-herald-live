A traffic cop who has a penchant for speed has racked up nearly R5 700 worth of fines in Nelson Mandela Bay with his Mercedes-Benz. Warren Rayners, who is in charge of organising the metro s roadblocks, has been caught on speed cameras 12 times since May last year. And while none of the fines has been paid, Rayners, 47, told Weekend Post he was not aware of the traffic violations. He has also been busted speeding in his work vehicle, a VW Polo, three times which saw him fined R1 250. Rayners was also fined R1 000 for ignoring a stop sign in Uitenhage. These fines have also not been paid and date back to July last year. I have not received any notifications. If I had, just like anybody else, I was going to go and present myself before the court and ask for leniency and then pay, he said. If I had warrants, do you think I would arrest anybody at the roadblock? No, that would be tantamount to having double standards. While the traffic and licensing department acknowledged Rayners s love for speed, it confirmed he had not been summonsed to appear in court nor was there a warrant out for his arrest.
