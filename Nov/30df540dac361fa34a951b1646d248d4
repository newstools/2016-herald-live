Hlompho Kekana Picture: TimesLIVE The wonder screamer goal by Mamelodi Sundowns star Hlompho Kekana for Bafana Bafana against Cameroon has been nominated among the 10 finalists for Fifa s goal of the year award to be decided by a public vote. South Africans are encouraged to get onto Fifa.com and vote for the cracker strike scored from within his own half by Kekana on March 26 in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Limbe. Kekana s goal appears to stand head and shoulders above the other nine nominations, but with strikes from world stars like Barcelona s Neymar and Argentina s Lionel Messi among the candidates the competition might turn into a popularity contest. Kekana s strike was scored in the first half taking the ball off Cameroon s Tony Tchani deep in Bafana s half. The Sundowns defensive midfielder advanced a few metres then lobbed in the strike over the head of backtracking goalkeeper Guy N dy Assembe still from a good 10m inside his own half on the right. Among other favourites for the award are Neymar s goal against Villarreal in La Liga in November last year where after a build-up from Barcelona s own penalty area the Brazilian flicked the ball over a defender before finishing. Another strong contender is from Venezuela girls player Daniuska Rodriguez. Showing great skill, Rodriguez beat two Colombian defenders one of them twice in the U17 Sudamericano Championship before blasting in an astounding goal.
