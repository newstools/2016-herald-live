The Professional Hunters Association of South Africa (Phasa) will on Tuesday oppose an application brought by some of its members challenging the resolution taken by the organisation to distance itself from captive-bred lion hunting and breeding lions for hunting. Phasa adopted the resolution at its AGM in November last year. However 13 Phasa members who did not adhere to the resolution had their membership suspended by the executive committee. They have gone to the Pretoria High Court to challenge their suspension. In its affidavit opposing their application Phasa said some of the applicants were members of another hunting organisation, known as the South African Predators Association which is in favour of captive-bred lion hunting. Phasa said it gave the applicants seven days within which to provide reasons why their membership should not be terminated. Phasa said after receiving responses from the 13 members it decided to lift the suspension of three members who had explained that they were not involved in breeding and hunting of captive lions. Phasa president Stan Burger said his organisation stood by its resolution to distance itself from captive-bred lion hunting and would defend its resolution in court.
