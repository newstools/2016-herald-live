Three children and an adult believed to be linked to a pick pocketing ring have been caught in Riviersonderend in the Western Cape only a day after allegedly stealing a cellphone from a customer inside the Sunridge Village shopping centre at the weekend. The arrest came after detectives identified the getaway car, a rented Nissan Micra, through video footage in the shopping centre car park. An alert was sent to police officials to be on the lookout for the car. It was later spotted in Riviersonderend at midday on Monday. A 23-year-old woman and three minors, aged eight, 16 and 17, were detained after 15 cellphones, suspected to be stolen, were found in the car. A man, who was also in the car, was arrested but later released due to lack of evidence.
