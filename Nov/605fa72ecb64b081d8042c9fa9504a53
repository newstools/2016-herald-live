President Zuma is the president and all of us in the ANC support him until next year when his term ends Youth League president Collen Maine said yesterday. This comes as several organisations and individuals have joined the call for Zuma to step down. Businessman Sipho Pityana the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution former finance minister Trevor Manuel Ahmed Kathrada Foundation chief executive Shan Bolton and one of the Occupy Luthuli House organisers, Gugu Ndima are just some of the Save South Africa steering committee members dismayed over Zuma s leadership.

The Youth League also came out in support of embattled Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe. National spokesman Mlondi Mkhize said the league had full confidence in Molefe, despite his being implicated in the State of Capture report released last week by the office of the public protector. We reaffirm our support for comrade Brian Molefe and the management team he leads Mkhize said. He remained a shining diamond that represents black excellency.
