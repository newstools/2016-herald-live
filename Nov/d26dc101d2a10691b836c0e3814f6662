The R4.5-million Khoisan Rock Art Centre project in Joubertina has been vandalised Picture: Supplied The controversial R4.5-million Khoisan Rock Art Centre project in Joubertina is still in shambles more than 10 years after construction started. While the centre was meant to celebrate the Khoisan community, it has now been vandalised, with roof timbers stripped and parts of the fencing stolen. And the Gamtkwa Khoisan Council believes every project meant to celebrate the Khoisan in the Sarah Baartman area is falling apart. Council representative Kobus Reichert described the project as a sad state of affairs. Our culture is now abused to enrich certain people. The government has proven with this project and others that they don t take us seriously, he said. Construction was started in September 2006 and was to be completed by March 2009, according to the construction schedule. But the centre once touted as a future Langkloof tourism hotspot has become a white elephant after construction stopped six years ago. The project was managed by the national Tourism Department and allegations of fraud and corruption surrounding the centre emerged in 2010.
