SANDF members have returned household goods to the home of a woman who was evicted last week Picture: Devon Koen A Port Elizabeth High Court judge is expected to hear a contempt of court case against the departments of Defence and Public Works and two members of the SA National Defence Force this morning for not obeying a court order issued late on Friday. The departments, along with Colonel Veli Phakathi and Colonel Desire Fouche, in their personal capacity, have been ordered to appear before Judge Glenn Goosen to explain why they allegedly ignored his orders to restore Alta Smit s belongings to her home on the Forest Hill military base. Last Friday, SANDF members evicted Alta Smit and dumped her belongings at the City Hall. Later the same day, Goosen ordered that the SANDF restore her goods to her home. While the household goods were removed from the City Hall after spending the night in the rain, they were returned to the house on Tuesday. Smit, represented by advocates Hannelie Bakker and Candace Mey, said it seemed that no one would take responsibility for what had happened to her goods. SANDF national spokesman Brigadier-General Xolani Mabanga said yesterday the military would not give further comment on the matter.
