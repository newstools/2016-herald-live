The chief of police in the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department Bafana Mahlabe has resigned the city announced on Wednesday. Ekurhuleni executive mayor Mzwandile Masina said the city received a letter of resignation from Mahlaba this week and was left with no choice but to accept it. &#8220;Although this development was unexpected after carefully considering the matter I have also accepted the resignation of the chief of police because it is my view that you must avoid standing in someone s way to pursue other ambition &#8221; Masina said. Mahlabe started in the position at the EMPD on October 1 2015. General Isaac Mapiyeye has been appointed the acting chief of police from December 1. The process to get a new chief will begin at Thursday s council sitting. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
