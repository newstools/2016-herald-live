Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane on Tuesday confirmed that the &#8220;motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma will be debated in Parliament on Thursday&#8221;. &#8220;Jacob Zuma s day of reckoning has now been confirmed set in motion and will be debated in Parliament for all South Africans to witness &#8221; said Maimane. The party had threatened legal action after it appeared that National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete had not scheduled the debate despite Maimane having &#8220;tabled this motion 20 days ago&#8221;. The date has however now been confirmed. &#8220;Since then the release of the public protector s State of Capture report and its contents has vindicated this decision &#8221; Maimane said. &#8220;This is not a DA motion. This is not an ANC (African National Congress) motion. This is a non-partisan motion that affords all 400 members of Parliament the opportunity to either speak for the people or to protect Jacob Zuma and his corruption. &#8220;The president was elected by Parliament and thus must be removed by Parliament.&#8221; The DA took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to say that &#8220;assuming that all opposition parties choose to vote we need at least 50 of the 249 ANC MPS to vote with conscience&#8221;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
