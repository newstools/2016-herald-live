Picture: Nomahlubi Jordaan Convicted former Johannesburg African National Congress (ANC) youth league leader Patrick Wisani will be sentenced next month for the murder of his girlfriend. Wisani was on Monday found guilty by the Johannesburg High Court of the murder of his girlfriend Nosipho Mandleleni. Wisani had been accused of beating Mandleleni to death with a sjambok and broomstick in the room they shared in Yeoville Johannesburg in September 2015. He also faced charges of allegedly assaulting his late partner s twin sister Siphokazi and her friend in May 2016 in an apparent attempt to intimidate Siphokazi into not testifying against him. On the court s advice Wisani who conducted his own defence during his trial has sought legal representation for mitigation of his sentence. On Tuesday he informed the court that his family has &#8220;informally&#8221; reached an agreement with an advocate to represent him. &#8220;But due to time constraints my family and the advocate could not conclude the agreement. They are hoping to conclude the discussions with advocate [before his next court appearance]&#8221;. Wisani asked the court to postpone the matter to December 12 for arguments in mitigation and aggravation of sentence. He assured Judge Mohamed Ismail that the matter will resume on that day.
