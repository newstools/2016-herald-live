The four suspects fled only at about 2am yesterday. The men held her hostage and tied her up inside the house, he said. The suspects assaulted her and managed to break open the wall safe and steal the contents. Her house was also ransacked. The police were only alerted at about 6am. The woman is in shock and traumatised. Detectives are still attempting to gather all the details. Rheeder said it was unknown how the men had gained entry.
