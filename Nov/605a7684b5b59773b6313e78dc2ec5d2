REUTERS/Aly Song Imports of cold-rolled steel products, particularly from China, are hurting South African producers, initial findings from a domestic trade agency showed yesterday, potentially paving the way for additional import duties. Domestic steel producers have said China, which produces half the world s steel, has been dumping excess out put in this country as consumption at home wanes and these low-priced imports have resulted in low sales volumes for the domestic firms. The International Trade Administration Commission of SA (ITAC) launched an investigation in July into whether to impose safeguard duties, also called emergency tariffs, on imports of cold-rolled steel from a number of countries including China, at the request of steelmaker Arcelor Mittal South Africa.
