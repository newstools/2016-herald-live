Three teenage girls who were watching a movie at home in Cotswold were among the victims of at least four reported cases of house robbery at the weekend in Port Elizabeth. The three girls were at home in Arends Street when two men, one armed with a firearm, entered the room, police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said. The suspects made off with three laptops and two cellphones, he said. The second incident occurred at a house in Korkie Street, Bloemendal, where a grandmother, 57, and her granddaughter, 4, had been sleeping on Saturday. She found nine armed men with their faces covered, Labans said. They ransacked the house, taking food, a DVD player, microwave, bedding and bank cards. In another incident, a woman, 44, from Ncukutu Street in Walmer was woken by a torch shining in her face during the early hours of Sunday. Six men, five of them with knives and the other with a gun, demanded money. They made off with two plasma TVs, a laptop, phone, jewellery and a handbag. A woman, 37, from Couldridge Road, Schauderville, was overpowered by two men when she responded to a knock at the door. They made off with three pairs of takkies, a ring, a chain, a cellphone and a music box. Police are investigating. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
