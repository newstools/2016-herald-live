There have been numerous pleas recently, arising from the low water levels in our dams, to reduce water consumption. Having heeded the request, as I have been using my grey water and rainwater where possible to reduce my consumption, I was disappointed to find that my water costs had not decreased in proportion to my decrease in consumption. On investigation I discovered that a sneaky way of raising additional income over and above the cost per kilolitre and availability charge is the sewerage charge, which is linked to water usage. Now, I do not have a problem with this method of charging, since the more you flush the more sewerage you create, which requires processing. What I do have a problem with is that there is a minimal charge of R103.08 in addition to the availability charge of R33.49. This means that were you not to flush at all during the month, your sewerage cost for the month would be R136.57. This anomaly arises because the municipality has decided that the average household uses in excess of 11kl of water per month on flushing. According to Annette Lovemore ( Simple things we can all do to save more water , November 17), each flush uses between 12 and 15l which, over a 30-day period, translates into 31 to 24 flushes a day. This, for a normal household, seems rather excessive. The point of my letter is, what incentive is there to those who have made an attempt and have reduced their water consumption below the 11kl per month? Come on DA council, get rid of this discriminating practice, which was obviously introduced by the previous council. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
