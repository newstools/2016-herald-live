Two would-be burglars were caught in the ceiling of the Heugh Road KFC at about 2am yesterday. The men, aged 28 and 35, were caught after police and Atlas Security climbed onto the roof after looking through a window and seeing parts of the ceiling lying inside the shop. Atlas Security operations manager Monty Montgomery said the roof sensor activated shortly after the men broke in through the roof. They were inside the shop. When they heard the police and Atlas arrive, the men climbed back into the ceiling in an attempt to escape, he said. The building was surrounded. My team and the police climbed onto the roof and gained entry inside the ceiling. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said a crowbar and hammer were found on the roof. The officials found the two men hiding behind fans and parts of the ceiling in the roof, she said. Naidu said burglars gaining access to business premises through the roof and ceiling, mainly at night, was an issue. Businesses with safes on site need to be vigilant. She was referring to the angle grinder gang which accesses businesses through the ceiling and spends hours angle-grinding the safe open. Yesterday morning, two other businesses, one in North End and another in Sidwell, had also reported criminals breaking in through the roof. In April, the same KFC was robbed by four men who climbed through the drive-through window shortly before closing time. Naidu warned that as the festive season approached, businesses needed to be extra cautious about keeping money on site. Depositing or drawing large sums of money is equally dangerous, she said. If you must keep money on site, use a drop safe and contract a money collecting company. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
