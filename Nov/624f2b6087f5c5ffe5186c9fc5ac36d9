Sport Minister Fikile Mbalula Picture: Anesh Debiky / Gallo Images South Africa s sports minister branded Sunette Viljoen, the country s Olympic javelin silver medallist, as the most arrogant and thankless person . . . I ve ever met in an angry spat yesterday over cash bonuses. Fikile Mbalula and Viljoen exchanged insults on Twitter in the latest flare-up of a controversy in which the minister has been accused of breaking a promise to pay R70 000 to silver medal winners at the Rio Games. Mbalula said in a series of tweets: What was due to her was payed. [sic] [She] declared for all to kno[w] she doesn t want the money . . . now she needs the money I must jump. &nbsp; Viljoen earlier tweeted direct messages from Mbalula in which he wrote: You said you don t need it. So I stick with your wishes. She replied on Twitter saying she had never, ever uttered these words. This is how you are treated for winning an Olympic medal. What a disgrace .
