BACK IN ACTION: Lebogang Mabatle has been recalled to the Banyana Banyana squad. Picture: GALLO IMAGES In what was a dignified departure from Vera Pauw s fractious reign as Banyana coach, interim coach Desiree Ellis said the door was not closed on any players who did not make the squad for the African Women s Championship. The tournament will be held in Cameroon from November 19 to December 3. Among the exclusions were Sanah Mollo and Lebohang Ramalepe, but Ellis said they should not feel hard done by. Amogelang Motau, Yolula Tsawe, Lebogang Mabatle, Silindile Ngubane and Andisiwe Mgcoyi, who all missed the women s soccer tournament at the Rio Olympics, have been recalled. We looked at players we have and we think [those] we ve picked will be able to do the job for us, Ellis said. However, the door is not closed for anyone. The national team belongs to the nation and when players raise their hands, we have to give them an opportunity.&#8221; We want to play a more attacking style of football. We want to allow our creative players to have free rein. South Africa finished fourth in the 2014 edition in Namibia and narrowly missed out on World Cup qualification after losing 1-0 to the Ivory Coast in the bronze medal match.
