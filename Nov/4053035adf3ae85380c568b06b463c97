Luthando Siyoni is testifying in the Panayiotou murder trial Picture: Eugene Coetzee State advocate Marius Stander has &#8211; with the permission of the Port Elizabeth High Court &#8211; moved to discredit Section 204 witness Luthando Siyoni. This means Siyoni, who initially confessed to acting as a middleman in Jayde Panayiotou&#8217;s murder, runs the risk of not being granted indemnity &#8211; currently protecting him from prosecution for the teacher&#8217;s murder. Siyoni, like his girlfriend Babalwa Breakfast, backtracked on his statements to police, claiming to have no involvement in Jayde&#8217;s murder, save for becoming aware of the hit plot after April 21 last year. Siyoni returns to the stand on Wednesday afternoon Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
