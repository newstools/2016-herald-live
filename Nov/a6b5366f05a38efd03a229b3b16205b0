STAYING FOCUSED: Professor Tebello Nyokong at Rhodes University Picture: GARY HORLOR Nyokong leads laser research It may sound like something out of a science fiction novel, but a tough-as-nails Rhodes University professor and her research team have been looking at how to use lasers and nanotechnology to fight cancer and help pilots land aircraft safely. Distinguished professor of medicinal chemistry and nanotechnology Tebello Nyokong and her team were recently recognised by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research s National Laser Centre (CSIR-NLC) for the role they play in shaping young minds to use technology for the betterment of society. Nyokong and her team were given certificates for training the most doctoral students in one year and for publishing the most academic articles, at an event hosted at Stellenbosch University last week. The academic at the helm of Rhodes DST/Mintek Nanotechnology Innovation Centre and her research team, which consisted of six PhD and three master s students, published 63 papers in international academic journals with 58 of them funded by the CSIR-NLC. Speaking about her projects, Nyokong said the group had researched how to protect pilots from being lasered while landing aircraft.
