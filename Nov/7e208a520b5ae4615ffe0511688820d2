Nelson Mandela Bay municipality has asked households to reduce water usage to 250 litres as the city faces a water shortage. Infrastructure, electricity and engineering political head Annette Lovemore said: We call upon the households to use a maximum of 250 l of water a day. This is a saving from the normal household of 400 l per day. If we do this for the next week, we should be out of the woods.
