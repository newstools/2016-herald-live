Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has been asked to explain controversial &#8220;policing-related issues currently in the public domain&#8221; to Parliament. A cloud is hanging over acting police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane who is under investigation by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). TMG Digital reported last week that the police watchdog was conducting the probe into Phalane a career policeman who lives in a house estimated to be worth R8-million on a luxury estate north of Pretoria. Nhleko has been accused by forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan who reported the acting commissioner to Ipid of ignoring a report questioning the source of his apparent wealth submitted by a whistleblower. And Eyewitness News has reported on the existence of explosive telephone recordings that have emerged which imply that Nhleko and Hawks investigators were conspiring to implicate Ipid head Robert McBride in a nearly decade-old attempted murder case. Parliament s portfolio committee on police chairman Francois Beukman said the committee had noted investigations involving the police and Ipid and wanted urgent clarification on the issues. &#8220;We need assurances that the executive is dealing with the matters at hand &#8221; said Beukman in a statement on Monday. The committee performs an oversight role over the police and Ipid. &#8220;We need stability in our law enforcement agencies at all times and we cannot allow a situation where public confidence in these institutions is eroded by inter-agency conflicts &#8221; said Beukman He said the fight against crime should be the number one priority of law enforcement agencies. Nhleko is due to appear before the committee on December 7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
