South African Airways Cargo has introduced a new dedicated service for domestic pets, offering lounge facilities to reduce travel stress. The facility would minimise environmental factors that could affect pets comfort and safety, while serving as a value-added service to increase satisfaction from pet owners, SAA said. The pet lounge is manned by a specialised team providing handling and coordination services, making sure every travelling pet enjoys a comfortable and hygienic environment while waiting to be escorted on board their flight, it says. The hands-on approach highlights our resolve to care about the welfare of live animals processed through SAA Cargo s facilities, general manager Tleli Makhetha said. Pet restrictions still apply and pets must be in a container. All South African airlines still prohibit the transportation of lizards, snakes and goats for domestic travel.
