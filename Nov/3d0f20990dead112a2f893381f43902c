PROTEST ACTION: Dismissed public toilet cleaners demand their jobs back yesterday. Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN The taxi-rank toilet cleaners who lost their jobs last week staged a sit-in at the Uitenhage Town Hall yesterday. They lost their jobs as municipal staff will now clean the toilets at the Border Alliance Taxi Rank. The work was previously outsourced but cost-cutting led to the contracts not being renewed. The cleaners started as volunteers in 2013 but were absorbed by Plateau Solution, hired to clean the toilets for the past three months. They were joined by about 90 residents of KwaLanga, Rosedale and Gerald Smith while they sang freedom songs inside the Town Hall. The irate cleaners have since locked the toilets at the taxi rank on the corner of Thornhill Street and Durban Road. One of them, Julia Nketcheni, 79, of KwaNobuhle, said: I have been helping here for several years but without pay. They have been promising people jobs but all this was in vain.
