Port Elizabeth triathletes taking part in the Standard Bank 5150 Nelson Mandela Bay at Kings Beach tomorrow say they are fit, primed and ready to impress. The event, which will be making its debut in PE, has attracted 700 athletes. Most of the participants are from the Eastern Cape (379), followed by the Western Cape (57) and Gauteng (48). Siyaphambili Triathlon Participation development programme manager and coach Justin Bulter, who will be taking part in the main event, said he was happy that the race had made its way to the city. He said he would use it as training for the bigger race, the Ironman 70.3, which takes place in East London early next year. I am happy that the race is at home, Bulter said. It will be my first time taking part in the 5150, although I have done many other Ironman races before. My preparations have gone well. The 25-year-old said he was looking for a comfortable finish. Women s triathlete Liza Kingston, who has been participating in Ironman races for almost a decade, said she was excited about witnessing the support tomorrow. I have been taking part in triathlon for nine years, starting with the Summer Series Triathlon in 2008, Kingston, who lives in Summerstrand, said.
