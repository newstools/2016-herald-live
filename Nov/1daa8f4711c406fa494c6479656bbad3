ON A MISSION: Lawson Naidoo, of the Council for Advancement of the South African Constitution, left, Sipho Pityana, centre, and businessman Mkhuseli Jack arrive for a Save SA meeting in Port Elizabeth Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI Civic group Save South Africa is hoping to add the voices of the people of Uitenhage to its motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma later this week. The group, which claims to represent all South Africans, said many had lost faith in Zuma and it was now time that parliament did something to remedy the situation. Over the last few months there has been a growing chorus of voices from all sectors of society calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down, Save SA said yesterday. These voices range from urban to rural, labour organisations and leaders, business organisations and chief executives. They are joined by the faith community, the arts and culture and academic community, young and old, male and female. Now the group has set its sights on Uitenhage and hopes to add its residents voices to its growing movement when it hosts a public meeting at the Babs Madlakane Hall in KwaNobuhle on Wednesday at 5.30pm. Political analyst and author Prince Mashele will be the main guest speaker. A large crowd attended a similar meeting by Save SA at the Nangoza Jebe Hall about two weeks ago.
