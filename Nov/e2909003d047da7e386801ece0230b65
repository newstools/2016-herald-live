Award-winning duo Mafikizolo will perform at the Music Festival Picture: Fredlin Adriaan The fifth annual Ebubeleni Music Festival promises a bigger and better line-up than ever before on Friday, December 30 at the Aldo Scribante Racetrack in Port Elizabeth. With more than 15 000 festinos in attendance last year, organisers are hoping for an even better turnout with the relocation of the event to Scribante. Ebubeleni project manager Marc Mahambehlala said they had been looking for a place to call home for the festival and said the racetrack seemed to be exactly what we have been looking for . There s plenty of safe parking, massive revellers space to picnic and dance and there are braai facilities, and it s [easily located] for people coming from all the townships and suburbs entering Port Elizabeth, Mahambehlala said. Mahambehlala said this year s line-up had been carefully selected to cater for both young and old and everyone in-between. The artists include award-winning duo Mafikizolo, Tsepo Tshola, TiMO ODV, Fifi Cooper, Emtee, newcomer Babes Wodumo, DJ duo Sphectacula and Naves, and PE-born musicians such as Vusi Nova, Phinda Matlala and NaakMusiq.

Golden circle is R250, VIP R700 per person and cooler box tickets are R50. The gates will open at 10am, with the festival starting from noon and running until late.
