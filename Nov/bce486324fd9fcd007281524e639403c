WATER CAPERS: Artists Franck Rabilier and Delphine Lechifflart with their daughter, Ondja Rabilier, 8 Picture: EUGENE COETZEE French acrobats sail their show to public at yacht club A globe-trotting French family travel where the tides and weather take them and now they have sailed into the Windy City to perform their aerial acrobatics show at the Algoa Bay Yacht Club. Artists Delphine Lechifflart, 46, and Franck Rabilier, 48, said yesterday that although their Port Elizabeth shows only start on Friday, they had raced to reach the city this past weekend to beat fierce winds and high swells. We pushed to arrive early so we were safe by Sunday. We are only in South Africa for three months because that is the window that the weather gives us, so we cannot do all that we want, Lechifflart said. Despite having travelled around the world twice on their yacht La Loupiote, this is their first time in South Africa, starting with a performance of their show in Richards Bay last week. It went very well the people were very surprised because I think it was new to them, Lechifflart said. They have started to explore Central and took their eight-year-old daughter, Ondja, to visit the museum. She is not in the show not yet! It would be too much for a child, but maybe one day, Lechifflart said, adding that their elder daughter, Loeva, 16, was at school in France. She left the boat last year she chose another life after 11 years on board. The couple are trained in the circus art of aerial acrobatics and use the mast, boom, rigging and other parts of their boat as their stage. They have acted in front of audiences of up to 1 000 people.
