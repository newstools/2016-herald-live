VOTING DAY: Political parties at a polling station in New Brighton yesterday Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN Young people outnumbered but no hitches as by-elections take place in two vacant wards Elderly residents came out in numbers to vote in by elections in two Bay wards yesterday. And while pensioners were seen eagerly lining up in Ward 14 (New Brighton) and Ward 4 (Walmer), only a small number of youngsters were seen casting their votes. Both wards were won by the ANC during theAugust local government elections. Ward 4 councillor candidate Nceba Dywili was gunned down just a week before the elections while dropping off a colleague in Zwide.

At 6am a number of people were already queuing outside voting stations, with many wanting to vote before leaving for work.
