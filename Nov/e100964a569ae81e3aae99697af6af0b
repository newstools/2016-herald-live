&nbsp; The producers of Isibaya Bomb Productions have lifted the lid on an audition scam that has attempted to swindle fans out of their hard earned cash. The scamsters asked fans of the television show to send short videos of themselves and to pay to audition for the show. In one part of the scam victims are asked to pay R1 250 to be a part of the casting agency . It also promises to pay successful candidates R950 a day for their troubles. Screenshots of the scam were uploaded by the company recently with the assurance that they would never ask fans to pay to audition. Of course Isibaya is not the first soapie to be plagued by fake auditions. In April Muvhango s production team urged the public to be aware of an audition scam leading to the show cutting ties with its casting agency because of the agency s name being used falsely in the scam. A similar scam hit popular SABC 1 drama Uzalo three months later with the show s producers warning of a fake Facebook page advertising auditions for the show. Uzalo is definitely not holding any auditions. Any reports that the production is holding auditions are false and we urge the public to ignore these announcements and to look to the official Uzalo Facebook Twitter and Instagram pages for any announcements about such developments Uzalo publicist Marang Setshwaelo told TshisaLIVE at the time.
