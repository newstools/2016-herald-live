The bakkie used in the cash-in-transit heist at the Quick Shop at Rink Auto Centre Engen in Central on Monday has been found. The white Nissan 1 400 bakkie was found abandoned in Middle Street, North End, at about 8am yesterday. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said the bakkie had been stolen in the Mount Road area four weeks ago. The robbery happened after a guard was held at gunpoint and forced to open a drop safe. As the two men fled, another security guard gave chase leading to a shootout. Bullet casings found in the back of the bakkie had been taken for forensic testing, Janse van Rensburg said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
