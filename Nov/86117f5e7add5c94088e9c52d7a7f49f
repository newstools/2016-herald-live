The Hawks have confirmed that they will be investigating corruption charges laid by the Democratic Alliance against President Jacob Zuma relating to his role in state capture DA leader Mmusi Maimane says. He said he had received official confirmation at the weekend from the Head of the Serious Commercial Crimes Unit at the Hawks that the criminal charges would be investigated. &#8220;I will be meeting with him within the next few days on his request as the investigation begins. This means we are another step closer to seeing Jacob Zuma face the consequences of his corruption &#8221; Maimane told a public meeting at Ngqurha in Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday. These charges he said were in addition to the 783 charges of corruption which must be reinstituted as per the Supreme Court of Appeal as well as the Nkandla corruption charges he laid in March 2014. &#8220;I will be seeking clarity from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) as to the status of these charges.&#8221; Maimane believed the DA was winning the war on corruption which it was fighting at every sphere of government. This corruption was &#8220;modelled&#8221; by Zuma he charged but vowed that he (Zuma) would not get away with it. &#8220;Corruption is the enemy which steals opportunity from our people. It steals jobs healthcare basic services and the change of a better life. &#8220;Yet we have a President who believes that corruption is a Western paradigm crime where there are no victims . &#8220;He could not be more wrong &#8221; Maimane asserted. He said that the DA would continue to wage the war on corruption. &#8220;Whether in government or in opposition we will use the Courts Parliament and the Public Protector to ensure justice is served and those who steal the people s money are prosecuted &#8221; the DA leader warned.
