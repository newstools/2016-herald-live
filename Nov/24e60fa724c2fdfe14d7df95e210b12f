Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson Picture: Gallo Images / Nardus Engelbrecht Four months after Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson promised to give the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality R150-million to cut down on power theft and install electricity in shacks, the money has yet to materialise. The municipality is adamant that all the necessary documents and business plans have been sitting on Joemat-Pettersson s desk for the past 2 months waiting for her approval. The city says she has also not responded to letters from the municipality, effectively putting on hold its plans to roll out innovative electricity project. Joemat-Pettersson promised to give the money to the metro amid huge fanfare in July, adding that the municipality could receive even more money if it was spent quickly. At a municipal public accounts committee meeting, acting executive director for electricity Peter Neilson said Joemat-Pettersson s promise had yet to be fulfilled. The money will be used for an innovative electricity project which will see 15 000 households formally electrified. From where we stand, the minister has to sign a contractual its agreement as required. Once she has done that, she can send it to the city manager to sign, he said. All the required documents are in order. They have been sitting at her desk for the past 2 months.
