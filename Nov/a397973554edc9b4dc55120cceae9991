Republican president-elect Donald Trump delivers his acceptance speech Picture: Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images / AFP Donald Trump said Wednesday he would bind the nation&#8217;s deep wounds and be a president &#8220;for all Americans,&#8221; as he praised his defeated rival Hillary Clinton for her years of public service. Riding a wave of euphoria from his supporters at a victory party in his home city of New York, Trump sought to bury the divisions and rancor that had made the 18-month presidential campaign so toxic. &#8220;For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I&#8217;m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country,&#8221; Trump said, during his speech proclaiming a stunning victory in the White House race. &#8220;I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all of Americans.&#8221; He was also noticeably conciliatory toward his vanquished rival, whom he has spent months berating as a corrupt favorite of the Washington establishment who broke the law by using a private server to send and receive classified data. &#8220;Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean that very sincerely.&#8221; The provocative billionaire president-elect, 70, said Clinton telephoned him to concede the race shortly after the state of Pennsylvania, which has voted Democratic in presidential races since 1992, was slotted into his win column. &#8220;She congratulated us &#8211; it is about us &#8211; on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign,&#8221; he said. The real estate mogul also pledged to &#8220;deal fairly with everyone,&#8221; including &#8220;all other nations.&#8221; &#8220;We will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will have great relationships,&#8221; he added. &#8220;While the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning,&#8221; Trump said, in a nod to the grass-roots anti-establishment, anti-Washington ground swell that upended the race with historic results. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to get to work immediately for the American people, and we&#8217;re going to be doing a job that, hopefully, you will be so proud of your president.&#8221; &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
