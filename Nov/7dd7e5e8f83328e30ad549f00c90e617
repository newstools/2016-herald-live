Portia &#8220;Pankie&#8221; Sizani Picture: Eugene Coetzee / The Herald Defence cites magistrate s links to Department of Education In an unexpected twist yesterday, Portia Pankie Sizani s legal team brought an application for the magistrate presiding over her fraud case to recuse himself as he could be perceived to be biased. The Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court heard that magistrate Mputumi Mpofu s wife, a teacher in Queenstown, had applied for a transfer to Port Elizabeth. The legal team for the wife of former ANC parliamentary chief whip Stone Sizani implied this could affect the magistrate s judgment in the matter. Led by Advocate Renee van Rooyen SC, under instruction from Advocate Johan Wessels, the defence did not accuse the magistrate outright of being biased, but made allegations that Mpofu s relationship with the Department of Education, regardless of how remote, could lead to the perception that he was biased. Citing judgments in other cases, Van Rooyen said the defence did not need to prove bias, they only needed to find some aspect within his actions that could leave the impression of bias.
