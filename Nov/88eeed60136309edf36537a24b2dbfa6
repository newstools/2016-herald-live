While Eskom said last week that early work at the proposed Thyspunt nuclear project could start in March, once cabinet approves the Integrated Resource Plan, it has since clarified that site clearing would only start when all the required documents had been approved. Eskom media officer Nto Rikhotso said: We are awaiting approval from the Department of Environmental Affairs on the EIA and the nuclear installation site licence from the National Nuclear Regulator. We hope to have these in the latter part of 2017. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
