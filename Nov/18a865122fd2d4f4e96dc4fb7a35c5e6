Port Elizabeth visual arts collective Colours of You SA is calling for entries with a street culture flavour to be exhibited at an art exhibition which will be held in the Baakens Valley later this month. The Bay group is hosting a Creative Festival on Sunday November 27 and, along with the food, music, dance and fashion, there will be an art exhibition. The deadline for portfolios to be submitted is November 21 and then, if portfolios are accepted, the work of art must be delivered by November 24. Show us your true colours! Have anything loud, proud or funny to say about being South African and which embrace and connect our diverse cultures? is the provocative challenge. Colours of You SA aims to provide a platform for young talent in Nelson Mandela Bay, promoting the city to people locally and abroad and this is its third annual event. With this in mind, artwork may be new or existing, in the genres of photography, sculpture, design or fine art and the theme is South African street culture: city, culture, people and colour. The organisers are also asking 25 Nelson Mandela Bay artists, designers and photographers to create works of art on skateboards with a similar theme. The Kings Beach Skateboarding crew will be giving a skate demonstration at the event. On the day of the Creative Festival, visitors can create pieces of art and work in a doodle area by showing off their artistic flair.
