NEW HIGH: David Leslie in the cockpit with the unnamed pilot, whose takeoff wasn t so good , according to the first-time flyer Picture: Supplied Rare disease sufferer David flown to attend big golfing event gala, meet legend Gary Player When David Leslie celebrated his 10th birthday in July it was an exceptionally special one doctors had told his grandparents he would not live past his sixth birthday. David, who lives in Malabar with his grandparents Abdon and Maureen Leslie, was born with Maroteaux-Lemy syndrome, an extremely rare genetic condition that causes a lack of a crucial enzyme in the body. The syndrome causes tissues and organs to enlarge and become inflamed or scarred. Skeletal abnormalities are also common. Last weekend, the little boy took up a special invitation from golfing legend Gary Player to be honoured at the Gary Player Invitational gala event at Sun City. The Gary Player Foundation, through donations to Wings and Wishes, has played a significant role in funding David s travelling costs to the Gary Player Foundationl in Cape Town. Speaking at Cape Recife School yesterday, David said he had enjoyed the weekend very much, but not the flying. David, who was flying for the first time as his grandfather drives him to Cape Town for treatment, told the pilot that while the takeoff wasn t so good the landing was much better . David was invited into the cockpit to look around after the flight. Gary Player was old but he was very nice.
