The Public Works Department will clean up the mess the SA National Defence Force left at the home of one of the women evicted from the Forest Hill military base last week. The department and her lawyers will meet at the house this morning to clean and assess any damage done to the household goods. This was decided between Alta Smit s legal representatives and lawyers representing Public Works, the Department of Defence, Colonel Veli Phakathi and Colonel Desir Fouche. Judge Glenn Goosen agreed in the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday to an interim agreement allowing Public Works to implement the urgent court order issued last Friday. This includes restoring Smit s belongings to the house in an orderly fashion and allowing her access.
