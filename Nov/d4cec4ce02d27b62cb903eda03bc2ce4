REMATCH, PERHAPS: Floyd Mayweather, left, and Manny Pacquiao during their welterweight unification championship bout in May last year. Picture: GETTY IMAGES Boxing icon Manny Pacquiao has teased fans about a possible rematch with Floyd Mayweather, smiling as he gamely showed off a suit with pictures of himself and Mayweather on the lining. Pacquiao, 37, posted on his social media accounts on Monday a photo of himself wearing the suit with his picture on the right side of the coat and Mayweather s on the left. Pacquiao, who was elected to the Philippines Senate in May, captioned the photo: Like my jacket? His post, which had received 215 000 likes on Facebook by yesterday, fuelled talk of Pacquiao-Mayweather 2, which began after he won the World Boxing Organisation welterweight title from Jessie Vargas earlier this month. Mayweather had taken up an invitation from Pacquiao to watch the Filipino multiple world champion s Las Vegas comeback from ringside. After the fight, Pacquiao said he was eager to avenge his loss to Mayweather last year in the richest fight in history. Not only for myself, but the fans of boxing want the rematch, then why not? We can easily talk about that. It is not a problem, Pacquiao said. Pacquiao s promoter Bob Arum said last week a rematch was likely. I give it 75%, Arum said. Do I know it s gonna happen? No. Do I know if Floyd wants the fight? No. Pacquiao s camp said yesterday, however, that talk of a rematch could wait. Boxing is not yet in his mind right now, Pacquiao s media relations chief, Aquiles Zonio, said. His next fight and his opponent would be known by January, he said.
