SABC board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe Picture: Gallo Images Lone SABC board member Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe has taken his fight against parliament to the Western Cape High Court to interdict its investigation into the public broadcaster just a day before it was meant to resume its inquiry. Maguvhe also wants the members of parliament who serve on the ad hoc committee set up to probe the SABC board s fitness to hold office disqualified from being members of the committee. In his last-ditch effort to have the inquiry halted Maguvhe states in court papers lodged yesterday that the ad hoc committee chaired by ANC MP Vincent Smith should be reconstituted. The matter was postponed to Friday. The ad hoc committee is supposed to begin today and will continue for two weeks. Its proposed witness list has up to 30 names including former board members and employees and Communications Minister Faith Muthambi. Speaker Baleka Mbete is listed as the first respondent, with secretary to parliament Gengezi Mgidlana as the second respondent. The ad hoc committee is third respondent as well as members of the portfolio committee on communications, who are not all members of the ad hoc committee. Smith said he found the timing of the interdict disconcerting that it happened in the last minute . But what I can tell you is that the adhoc committee meeting at 9am will continue.The actual inquiry only starts at2pm. A decision on a way forward will betaken after the 9am meeting he said. Smith confirmed he was made aware of the application by Maguvhe on Sunday at about 10pm. He said court papers were sent via e-mail on Saturday. I in consultation with the parliamentary legal team decided that we will defend it, he said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
