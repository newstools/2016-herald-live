The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has warned residents to reduce water usage dramatically as water storage levels are low. Dam levels have also dropped by 1% since last week. Capacity is now at 66.29%. Infrastructure, electricity and engineering political head Annette Lovemore said the city was facing the risk of water shortages this week if residents did not save water. Our reservoirs are at 50%, but we are hoping to up the levels to normal capacity by the end of the week, she said. This is a temporary issue, but there is a risk if we don t reduce usage. The rain is helping in a way, as people will not use that much water. For example, most people will not do laundry if is raining, she said.
