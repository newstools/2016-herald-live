German Chancellor Angela Merkel will seek a fourth term in next year sgeneral election, as the country struggles with a surge in far-right extremism, domestic terror attacks and an influx of more than one million migrants. Months of speculation over whether Merkel would seek re-election was put to rest yesterday morning after she told her Christian DemocraticUnion (CDU) party that she wished to lead them into the polls. The 62-year-old, who is widely regarded as the most powerful womanin the world, has presided over Europ e s strongest economy since 2005. A recent poll suggested up to 59% of Germans are in favour of her being re-elected, while just 39% want to see someone else in charge. Should she go on to serve a fourth term, Merkel would match the post-war record of her mentor, Helmut Kohl. Supporters say she would offer some much-needed stability to European politics,which has already been rocked by the UK s decision to leave the EU, aswell as Donald Trump s shock election victory in the United States. However, she has also come under intense criticism for her open door refugee policy, which saw hundreds of thousands enter the country last year. She stands for moderation and centrism instead of cheap headlines, CDU deputy leader Julia Kloecknersaid yesterday. Over the weekend, a draft manifesto containing a number of key pledges for a fourth Merkel term was widely leaked to newspapers in Germany. Several of its proposals have been interpreted as a shift to the right in a bid to win back support from alienated voters. Those proposals include a ban on wearing full veils in public court hearings and benefit cuts for migrants who refuse to integrate.
