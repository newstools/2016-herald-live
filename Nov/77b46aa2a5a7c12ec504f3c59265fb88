Mcebo Dlamini Picture: Neo Goba The legal team for Fees Must Fall leader Mcebo Dlamini has launched a high court application to have the charges against him withdrawn. This emerged after Dlamini appeared briefly in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court yesterday. The case was postponed to June 15. Speaking outside the court lawyer Thabo Kwinana said: There has been an admission from the national director of public prosecutions [Shaun Abrahams] when he answered a question as to the purpose of the meeting at Luthuli House he said it was to discuss how the state should deal with the Fees Must Fall process. Kwinana said he believed Dlamini s arrest was unlawful and illegal. We are not making an allegation we are merely taking them up on what [the National Prosecution Authority] disclosed on record before the people of South Africa he said. At Dlamini s bail hearing a week ago advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi argued that his arrest and prosecution was the result of a political conspiracy. Dlamini was granted bail of R2 000.
