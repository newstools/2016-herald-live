COOL HONOUR: Lara Derbyshire is the only ice hockey player from the Eastern Cape representing South Africa at the women s world champs. Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI Port Elizabeth ice hockey player Lara Derbyshire has made the region proud with her selection for the South Africa women s team. The national team will travel to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Women s World Championship Division II in Taipei, Taiwan next month. The tournament has South Africa grouped alongside Hong Kong, Bulgaria, Belgium and Chinese Taipei. Derbyshire, 30, who is a founder and a part of the Eastern Province Ice Hockey Association women s team, recently travelled to Cape Town where they par ticipated in the annual interprovincial tournament. It was at the interprovincial where she was noticed and made a name for herself. I was fortunate enough to be selected as part of the SA women s team, the only woman from the Eastern Cape, and this will be my first time representing my country. It s an absolute honour and a dream come true, Derbyshire said. She started playing inline roller hockey at the age of 11 and continued to play at St George s Park until just after her high school years. Derbyshire said that prior to the opening of the new ice rink at Baywest Mall, she and her club used to train at the Old Tramways ice rink, which closed down some years back. She returned to the sport when the new rink opened and co-founded the Eastern Province Ice Hockey Association. A group of us got together and started preparing to get ice hockey going in the Eastern Cape again and it has been running now as the Eastern Province Ice Hockey Association for just over a year, Derbyshire said. All expenses for the tour are for their own account and Derbyshire is still looking for sponsors.
