NMBM acting city manager Johann Mettler Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Fines and higher tariffs are on the cards in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro if water wastage continues. This comes after Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane told municipal officials this week that not enough was being done to save water. Acting city manager Johann Mettler said yesterday that although soft restrictions were already in place, they were not yielding results. We received information informally from the national department that we will be directed to go to the next level of restrictions, Mettler said. The introduction of punitive tariffs and fines were strong possibilities, but the council would have to approve these. Mettler said the metro was waiting for formal communication from Mokonyane. Millions of rands are lost by the metro every month due to water losses. In September, water losses accounted for 43.88% of the city&#8217;s total water usage. This included households not paying and wastage caused by leaks and burst pipes.
