EPWP worker Joyce Sanusi, 47, left, confronts DA Ward 40 councillor Jason Grobbelaar over a mysterious notice saying workers are barred from using toilets at the Kuyga Community Hall. File Photo. Picture: Eugene Coetzee Residents of Ward 40 (Kuyga)are up in arms, saying they do not have access to services from ward councillor Jason Grobbelaar s office as it is still closed. The office was closed by angry ANC members last month following the discovery of a notice calling for non-whites to use a separate toilet at the Kuyga Community Hall, where Grobbelaar s office is. Residents said it was now a battle to get proof of address printouts and other services from the councillor s office. Zoleka Daba, 41, said she had to wait for DA PR councillor Sebenzile Rafani to return from work and sign proof of addresses at his home. The Herald understands that the office remains closed due to a safety threat against Grobbelaar and Rafani. Neither Grobbelaar nor Rafani would comment, referring questions to the political leadership. Mayoral chief of staff Kristoff Adelbert said attempts were being made to resolve the matter. ANC Ward 40 branch chairman Boy Mantewu said everyone was affected by the closure of the councillor s office. We just want a response from the councillor, he said.
