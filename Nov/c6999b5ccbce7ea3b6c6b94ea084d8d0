Mango Airlines net loss of almost R37-million hasn t deterred FlySafair from wanting to buy the South African Airways-owned carrier. &#8220;Mango s fleet and operating model is closer to FlySafair s low-cost approach and would be a more natural extension to FlySafair s successful business model &#8221; FlySafair CEO Elmar Conradie said on Thursday. &#8220;Operating a larger fleet would afford us the opportunity to enjoy even larger economies of scale and through this sustain lower fares to the flying public.&#8221; Mango s loss emerged in Parliament on Wednesday when its financial results which are normally consolidated and hidden in its parent company s statements were released for the first time to the finance committee after persistent pressure from the Democratic Alliance. It came despite the airline carrying 3-million passengers last year a 21% increase over the previous year and FlySafair pointed out that Mango s loss occurred &#8220;despite the Airports Company of South Africa noting a trend towards an increase in domestic passenger traffic which has seen across its route network&#8221;. Mango chairman Rashid Wally s statement to the finance committee partially blamed the &#8220;weakening economy and over-traded market impacting average fares&#8221; but FlySafair said: &#8220;Mango s loss comes even though it has been accused of allegedly engaging in predatory pricing as it sub-leases aircraft from its parent company SAA at discounted prices allowing it to price flights at below operational costs.&#8221; FlySafair s head of sales and distribution Kirby Gordon said: &#8220;As it stands we are achieving a pleasingly low operating cost per seat which is allowing us to contest the market at the current low fares.&#8221; Gordon also said selling Mango &#8220;would also take some financial burden off the government&#8221;.
