The ANC Youth League yesterday launched a scathing attack on two of their own, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and parliamentary chief whip Jackson Mthembu, who was labelled a drunkard. ANCYL deputy president Desmond Moela attacked the two as well as former public protector Thuli Madonsela at the league s eThekwini elective conference in Durban. We have somebody in the ANC, Pravin Gordon s. I don t know his surname. I call him Gordon s. That Gordon s Gin, whatever, [he] is not the god of the ANC. Who is he? he said. Gordhan has been involved in a long-running controversy over whether or not he will be charged with the establishment of the so-called SA Revenue Service (SARS) rogue unit . Last month, the National Prosecuting Authority decided not to charge him for fraud and theft over the early retirement of a former SARS commissioner, Ivan Pillay. Moela said: Now, we are saying as the ANCYL, that old, retired man must find inner peace and leave us in peace. He must also face the law. Turning on Mthembu, he said: You can t have somebody called Jack Daniels, who is always drunk, speaking &#8230; without the mandate [of the ANC]. Last month, Mthembu said the ANC s national executive committee should resign following the party s poor performance in this year s local government elections. Moela said Madonsela and others, who he did not name, were puppets. We know they are conniving with the enemy. Why can t Thuli shut up and stop talking about issues of that office. Can she get a boyfriend please. Gordhan and Mthembu declined to comment. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
