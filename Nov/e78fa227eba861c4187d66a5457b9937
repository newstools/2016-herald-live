BRINGING HOPE: Members of the Real Village organisation hope to open an office in the Bay next year and help both children and adults Having faced adversity from a tender age, an Eastern Cape woman has made it her mission to make a difference in the lives of those living in poverty-stricken communities. radock-born Misiwe Ntshangase, 45, of Bluewater Bay, has committed herself to ending the cycle of poverty through the Restoration and Empowerment of Africa by Love (Real) Village initiative. Real Village, a national non-profit community development organisation, seeks to provide assistance to underprivileged youth by implementing the spirit of ubuntu. The organisation provides aftercare and homework supervision for children, and financial, budgeting and savings advice for adults. Ntshangase said the most important part about offering her time and energy to the programme was making a difference in someone s life. Doing this work comes with a sense of gratitude, especially because I too was in some of the children s shoes. I grew up in a big family of eight children and we used to wear torn shoes until my father was able to buy us decent school shoes, she said.
