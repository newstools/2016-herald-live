All are 18 Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN Unreal, excited and relieved. This is how three Port Elizabeth Grade 12 pupils described their feelings as they finished their exam yesterday. While matric exams officially end today with agricultural management and design, thousands of pupils started celebrating early after writing the third Afrikaans paper yesterday. Eastern Cape education spokesman Mali Mtima said even though there had been no irregularities throughout the exams, the department would release an official statement today. The matrics form part of the 94 928 full-time registered pupils who sat for exams this year. Two Bethelsdorp High School pupils Ramone Wagner, 20, and Kelsey Kerspey, 17, who concluded their exams yesterday with Afrikaans, said it had been stressful. I am so relieved to be finished. The exams have been hectic but not as hard as the September examinations, Wagner said. I m excited to be finally done with school, even though I am a bit nervous about next year as I have not decided what I want to do. Kerspay said: I like letting my imagination go wild and that s why I enjoyed the last paper. I m excited about next year and I plan to apply to the SANDF or SAPS music band. Kerspay said she would celebrate by staying indoors and unwinding. Pearson High School pupil Conor Jackson, 17, said he planned to celebrate with friends last night. We plan to have loads of fun after the stressful period. I m satisfied with my efforts and now I look forward to the day the results are released.
