Members of the body played a crucial role in the 1980s and early 90s unrest, and worked to ensure quality healthcare for largely black, coloured and Indian communities under the apartheid regime. The reunion is the first time in decades that they have gathered together to commemorate their work and to honour one another. Due to the racial climate at the time, the guild became a fraternity for doctors who fought discriminatory practices by medical aids and who put their own safety on the line to treat political prisoners and those injured in riots, who were too afraid to use public hospitals. Dr Jay Moodliar, a past president of the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (Pebco), delivered the keynote speech at the function.
