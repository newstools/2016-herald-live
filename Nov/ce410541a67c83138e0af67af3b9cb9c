Port Elizabeth sergeants win top team honour at SAPS annual excellence awards Two of Port Elizabeth s most dedicated men in blue came out tops at the Eastern Cape SAPS annual excellence awards in East London on Friday night. The awards, held at the Regent Hotel, recognise, honour and reward exceptional services rendered by diligent members of the police force. Members of the Port Elizabeth Flying Squad, sergeants Severiano Blundin and Sphumelele Msindwana, were awarded the Vispol team of the year award something they said would encourage them to do even more. Msindwana, 38, a second-generation policeman, said he had been with the police for 13 years and a member of the flying squad for 11. I ve always wanted to be a cop but I deferred and studied social work at Transkei University [now known as Walter Sisulu University]. But in my second year, I saw an advert which said SAPS was looking for people and I applied, Msindwana said. No stranger to winning awards, Blundin, 30, who recently won the Annual Tracker Individual Award for retrieving the most stolen and hijacked vehicles in the country, said it took a lot of hard work to do and achieve the things he and his partner did.
