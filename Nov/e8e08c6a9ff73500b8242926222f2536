Rhino Tears wines Congratulations to Rhino Tears wines on reaching a milestone R1-million donated to the South African National Parks (SANParks) Honorary Rangers for anti-poaching projects. R15 from every bottle sold goes to the Honorary Rangers volunteer organisation to support SANParks field rangers with tracker dogs, equipment for anti-poaching operations, and extreme terrain vehicles. Honorary Rangers chairperson Louis Lemmer said field rangers worked under tough conditions away from their families and facing constant danger from poachers. If we can make a difference by making their work easier, we are adding to their effectiveness in the bush. The equipment supplied to the field rangers answers that need, Lemmer said. Every bottle purchased really makes a difference. The cost of the anti-poaching war is expensive and the men and women involved need all the support they can get to fight a ruthless enemy, said Rhino Tears founder John Hooper. Rhino Tears wines are widely available from major retailers. They can also be ordered online on rhinotears.co.za, and a R10 donation can be made, without buying wine, by SMSing the word Rhino to 38730.
