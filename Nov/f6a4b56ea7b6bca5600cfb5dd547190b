A pistol was confiscated from a Cape Town primary school pupil after he used it to threaten other children police said on Saturday. The 12-year-old took the 9mm weapon to school in Eastridge Mitchells Plain said police spokesman FC van Wyk. &#8220;The pistol was traced to Polokwane where a robbery was reported during 2007. Police addressed the learners and educators of the primary school concerning the incident &#8221; said Van Wyk. The seizure took place as police in the sprawling suburb of 700 000 stepped up crime prevention operations in the run-up to the festive season. &#8220;A total of 51 crime prevention operations were held the past week throughout the cluster policing precinct &#8221; said Van Wyk. &#8220;Four suspects for whom warrants of arrest were issued were arrested during tracing operations. The warrants of arrest were issued for crimes involving armed robbery housebreaking and theft and contempt of court. &#8220;Roadblocks and vehicle checkpoints were also held and resulted in the issuing of 20 fines to the value of R22 500 for various road traffic offences.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
