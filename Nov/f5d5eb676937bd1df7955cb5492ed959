Does the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality not have a competent human resources department? How can ratepayers possibly be happy to pay an outrageous R534 090 fee to a recruitment company, for work that could and should be done internally? To state that such a fee was the least expensive of three quotes is merely proof of a rip-off industry, not an excuse for not doing one s own work. From The Herald s report ( Metro expected to backtrack on city boss decision , November 24), it seems the recruitment agency failed to conduct a thorough interview and failed to check references adequately. If so, rather than re-contracting with the recruitment firm (for another R -million), the municipality should be considering how the initial R534 090 can be recovered. Then professionalise the HR department and improve oversight. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
