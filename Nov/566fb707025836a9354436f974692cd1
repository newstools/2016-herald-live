The founder and chief executive of Bay group Elilox said such construction management alliances could grow business for both sectors. It s about spreading the sunshine finding a partner that does not threaten your organisational culture and with whom you can both benefit. It s about giving a sense of hope. Gasa said this yesterday during a break at the fifth Construction Management Conference in the city. Hosted by NMMU and Bloemfontein s Central University of Technology, the two-day conference is endorsed by the sector regulator, the South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions, and is being coordinated by NMMU s Professor John Smallwood. Gasa said about 80% of the 130 000 registered construction management contractors in South Africa were SMMEs. Most of these firms that had not closed down or moved away after this year s challenges had survived by establishing a rapport with larger companies.
