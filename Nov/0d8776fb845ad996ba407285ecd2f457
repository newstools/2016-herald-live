A 31-year-old suspect handed himself over to The Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit on Thursday and was detained on charges of rape, abduction and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. This after a woman was allegedly abducted in the early hours of October 1 after a night of partying at Caf Loxion in Parliament Street, Central and taken to Walmer. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse Van Rensburg said the woman alleged she was taken to a flat where one of the suspects tried to rape her. She managed to fight him off and that is when the suspect contacted two other suspects to fetch the woman from the flat. At that stage the woman was under the impression they were taking her back to Central, but instead they drove to a bushy area in Victoria Drive where she was allegedly raped by both men and badly assaulted. The suspects left her for dead in the bushes. The victim managed to find her way back to Victoria Drive and was assisted by members of the public. The suspect appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court on charges of abduction, rape and assault with intent to do grievance bodily harm. The suspect will remain in custody and will appear in court again on Wednesday. &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
