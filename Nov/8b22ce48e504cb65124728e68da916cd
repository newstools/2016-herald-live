A random stop-and-search by Dive Unit police officers led to the arrest this week of four men with R13 500 in fake bank notes. The find has prompted police to warn residents to be vigilant and on the lookout for card-skimming devices, as well as fraudulent notes. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said the four men, aged between 23 and 44, were arrested after the VW Polo they were in was spotted being driven recklessly in the Kwa-Dwesi area on Wednesday. Police stopped the car and searched it and the four occupants. The fake bank notes were found in the vehicle along with four cellphones and a card-skimming device. On further investigation, the officers were led to a house in Buyambo Street, Kwa-Dwesi. Public Order Policing Unit members assisted with the search of the house where a computer, printing equipment and a sheet of printed fake notes were found. All the devices were confiscated. Any information linked to card skimming or false notes can be directed to Commercial Crimes Unit detective Warrant Officer Neil Hoffman at 072-720-4606.
