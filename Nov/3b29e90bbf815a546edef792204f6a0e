Luna Paige Singer-songwriter Luna Paige will perform in Prince Albert tonight and travel to Port Elizabeth next month as part of a national tour to promote her new Afrikaans single and music video Gee My Ritme. Paige will be in the Bay at the Music Kitchen in Mangold Street on Friday, December 2. She will sing her own original material, telling the story of her professional journey in the industry and sharing glimpses of her personal journey. She released Gee My Ritme ahead of the tour, which starts today Paige said the past two years had been busy. In February she released her first Afrikaans single Groot Is Jy. After the release of her fifth CD, Borders &amp; Beyond in 2014, she focused her attention on the development of stage productions Die Ander Konsert and Korreltjie Kantel. The success of these productions at the Woordfees, KKNK and Free State Arts Festival motivated her to start a production company, Iluminar Productions. She then approached Chris Chameleon manager Denise Barnes to become her partner and together with the alreadyexisting productions Die Ander Konsert and Korreltjie Kantel, they are now developing three more productions. Iluminar has now reworked Korreltjie Kantel, a music production of the love story between Ingrid Jonker and Andr P Brink, and will release it in CD format next year. Iluminar also has plans for a brand new production for the Woordfees in March next year. In this show Konnexi! music and art lovers can expect stories and music by Paige, Pops Mohamed and award-winning animation artist, Charles Badenhorst, aka Bittervrug. Konnexi! will also tour across South Africa throughout next year. Paige s current tour takes in Prince Albert, Nieu Bethesda, Bethlehem, Johannesburg and Pretoria and ends in PE.
