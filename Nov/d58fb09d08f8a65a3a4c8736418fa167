TOILET TOWN: Ngunguluza backyard dwellers are calling for houses in this area Picture: YOLISWA SOBUWA KwaNobuhle backyard dwellers have shut down two municipal projects in their ward because they are not being allocated RDP housing from a nearby development. The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality built 300 toilets in Ward 45 last year but has yet to start building the RDP houses. The backyard dwellers believe that only three of them will get houses from the R25-million project. But acting municipal human settlements executive director Luthando Mabhoza said 30 houses would be given to backyard dwellers. Only 10% of the project can be allocated to the backyard dwellers in Ward 45, Mabhoza said. The rest will be shared by people to be moved to that area. In Ward 45, they want the whole project to be allocated to [residents].
