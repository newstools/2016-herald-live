Education only blemish as other entities all receive unqualified audit opinions The Eastern Cape has turned the tide and emerged as one of the most improved provinces to overhaul the finances of its 10 government departments. All departments and entities with the exception of the provincial Department of Education received unqualified audit opinions from auditor-general Kimi Makwetu for the 2015-16 financial year. This is a major improvement for the province, which had five qualified audits in the 2014-15 financial year and six the year before that. Makwetu presented the national and provincial audit outcomes for the 2015-16 financial year in parliament yesterday. Sound leadership and a stable political and administrative environment were listed among the reasons for the Eastern Cape s improved audit outcomes over the past three years. An unqualified audit is a thumbs-up from the AG that the various departments financial records are in a good state. It is not a reflection of the services provided by the departments. Makwetu said the 2015-16 audit outcomes indicated that the province had made strides in dealing with qualifications and increasing the number of clean audits.
