Clive Felix gave guests the background events which led to the building of the Fairview Sports and Community Centre during the official opening of the new facility in Willow Road, Fairview Picture: IVOR MARKMAN. Complex will also serve community, business Hundreds of guests celebrated the launch of a multimillion-rand sports and community centre at a black tie event held at the new complex in Fairview, Port Elizabeth, on Saturday night. The Fairview Multi Sports Complex in Willow Road, which expects to attract top national sports and other events to the Bay, forms part of a Port Elizabeth Land Restitution and Housing Association (Pelrha) initiative. Part of Pelrha s mandate is to help establish a good quality neighbourhood with facilities for families returning to the Fairview area. The association recently completed construction of the R36-million centre and spent a further R8-million on fencing and grassing the complex. Pelrha spokesman Clive Felix said they had used the money from the sale of a strip of land, which had formed part of their restitution claim to the government. Felix, who revealed that Pelrha had secured R42-million from its restitution claim, said this money had not been used to fund the new centre, but that the board had opted to finance it from the sale of the strip of land. We created a bursary scheme for children in the northern areas and the townships because that is where a lot of the claimants came from, he said.
