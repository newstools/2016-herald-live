Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma was charged with attempted murder last year and has now been told she still is officially a suspect in an alleged plot to kill her husband Picture: Kopano Tlape / GCIS National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Shaun Abrahams has dropped another bombshell telling President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s estranged fourth wife that she is officially a suspect in an alleged plot to kill her husband the Sunday Times reported. The national director of public prosecutions revealed this in a letter to Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma&#8217;s lawyers last month in response to her query about the status of a criminal case that saw her being banned from the president&#8217;s home in Nkandla it said. Ntuli-Zuma known as MaNtuli was kicked out of the Zuma homestead in January last year by State Security Minister David Mahlobo who told her she was being investigated in connection with a plot to poison Zuma the report said. Zuma s alleged poisoning apparently took place in June 2014. MaNtuli&#8217;s lawyer Ulrich Roux told the Sunday Times yesterday: &#8220;My client&#8217;s constitutional rights are being severely infringed upon and yet the head of the NPA, as he has done in other high-profile cases this year, refuses to accept any responsibility and sends a letter to me confirming that my client is regarded as a suspect in the matter. &#8220;It is clear to me that he has no grasp of what is contained in the docket in this matter. In the event that there was any shred of evidence implicating my client in a so-called attempt to kill Jacob Zuma, then why have they not arrested her or brought her before court? The docket was opened more than 18 months ago.&#8221; &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
