Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan refused to entertain any questions relating to the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) that took place on Sunday and Monday. As he was about to take questions after briefing the media after a breakfast session he hosted on Tuesday ahead of the World Economic Forum taking place in Davos Switzerland in January Gordhan warned the media that the briefing had nothing to do with the ANC. &#8220;Let me remind you at the beginning this is not an ANC press conference. It s scheduled for 2pm. &#8220;In as much as you want us to be disciplined please be disciplined. This is a press conference about work and Team South Africa that is going to work and the economic story that we need to explain and put forward as team South Africa.&#8221; Some Journalists however did not seem to have gotten Gordhan s message. &#8220;You mentioned the importance of responsible leadership and integrity and I just want to know if you supported the motion of no confidence against President Zuma &#8221; one journalist asked. To which Gordhan responded: &#8220;Ma m I m gonna rule you out of order. Please behave yourself. I made that rule very clear in the beginning. It s either we hear each other and cooperate in the right way or we are going to be mischievous. Please don t do that.&#8221; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
