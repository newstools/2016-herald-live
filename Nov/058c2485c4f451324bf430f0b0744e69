Residents occupying land illegally at Khayamnandi s toilet city have been given a month s reprieve before the court decides if they should be evicted. After a brief appearance at the Port Elizabeth High Court, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality s case against the residents was postponed for argument on December 15. The residents were not impressed with a further court postponement, but said moving was not an option. Zameka Sonanzi, 32, speaking for the residents, said: The municipality should move the people who are supposed to be moved to Khayamnandi to the land that has been identified for us. Municipal officials must register us. On Wednesday, about 200 residents blocked Old Uitenhage Road with burning tyres, saying they had been given municipal eviction notices in June. Acting human settlements head Luthando Mabhoza denied issuing eviction letters and said the municipality would act once the court made a decision.
