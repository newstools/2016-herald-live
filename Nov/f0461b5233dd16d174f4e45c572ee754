Conrad Gallagher Picture: RUVAN BOSHOFF The international celebrity chef behind one of Port Elizabeth s priciest new restaurants, who allegedly left a string of unpaid suppliers in his wake when he moved from Cape Town, is now being accused of using the same recipe to run his eatery in Richmond Hill. Conrad Gallagher, the Irish chef and owner of Gallagher s on Stanley, settled in the city with his Port Elizabeth-born wife, former beauty queen Candice Coetzee, and their two sons after leaving Cape Town earlier this year under a cloud of debt. But Gallagher, the youngest chef ever awarded two Michelin Stars, is now being pressured by several Nelson Mandela Bay suppliers, who have come forward to complain about his unpaid bills. Confronted recently about the debts, Gallagher admitted to having some bad debt with a few creditors in the Bay. Blaming bad luck, not understanding the local market and not being a perfect person , he said he was working towards clearing the debt and had already made major inroads in doing so. After our very quiet opening in July we were very busy, but in early September things started quietening down drastically, Gallagher said.
