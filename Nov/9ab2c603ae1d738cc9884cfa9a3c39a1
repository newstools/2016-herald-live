New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane after she briefed Parliament on the office&#8217;s annual performance for the 2015/16 financial year Picture: Ruvan Boshoff Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has denied a report that she has pressed charges against her predecessor Thuli Madonsela. Mkhwebane was commenting on a report by the Sunday Times on Sunday which said the basis for the &#8220;charges&#8221; was the alleged leak of an audio recording of a meeting between Madonsela and President Jacob Zuma. The interview was held as part of the so-called &#8220;State Capture&#8221; investigation. &#8220;It is not true that Adv. Mkhwebane laid charges against her predecessor. Instead she opened a case at the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria requesting an investigation into the alleged leaks to establish if they amount to a breach of section 7(2) of the Public Protector Act &#8221; the Public Protector s spokeswoman Kgalalelo Masibi said in a statement. Masibi said the decision to open a case was informed by complaints from the Presidency and the Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly. &#8220;In addition to these Adv. Mkhwebane received a media enquiry from Noseweek magazine in which the publication claimed to be in possession of a recording of her predecessor s meeting with Ms Mentor also relating to the State Capture investigation.&#8221; Masibi said Mkhwebane was concerned that these alleged leakages of evidence could compromise the trust that the public has in her office. It was this concern that led to her opening a case for investigation. &#8220;In order to maintain the credibility of the Public Protector South Africa and for the people to trust the institution we need to safeguard whatever evidence such people including whistle-blowers give to us &#8221; Mkhwebane said.
