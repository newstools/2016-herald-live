Mining production grew 3.4% last month compared with a year earlier, in line with expectations for a rebound in the sector and offering some positive news for third-quarter economic growth. The rise broke a run of 12months of contraction in the sector, which has been under pressure from a long period of low global economic growth and prices. Yesterday s data from Statistics SA ends the sector s releases for the third quarter. Output for the quarter was up 1.5% compared with the previous quarter. A resurgence in manufacturing and mining output drove a big turn around in real GDP growth to 3.3% quarter on quarter, from a shock 1.2% contraction in the first quarter. The long run of contractions mean the sector s output for the year to end last month is still 5.7% weaker than the same period last year though this is an improvement on a 6.8% decline in the year to August. Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan said a multitude of factors were attributed to the sector s underperformance, from increased operating costs to weaker commodity demand from China and low commodity prices. Commodity prices are expected to stabilise, but remain suppressed , Kaplan said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
