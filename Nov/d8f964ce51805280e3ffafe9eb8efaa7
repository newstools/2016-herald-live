Santa&#8217;s New Helpers will retail for R180 Port Elizabeth s irrepressible Max and Sue Hoppe are launching a new children s book, Santa&#8217;s New Helpers, to arrive just in time for Christmas. Bay architect and artist Theresa Hardman has illustrated the book and will host the launch at her design studio at 59 Main Road at 5.30pm on Wednesday. Santa s New Helpers is our first illustrated children s book, available in English, Afrikaans and isi-Xhosa. We feel it is great for kids to have all three languages, to help them learn official languages by comparing, the pair behind the El Gecko publishing house said. Max has written Santa s New Helpers as the first in a new series called Tales from the Waterhole, to be illustrated by Hardman. Santa s New Helpers Abancedisi Abatsha Baka Santa in isi-Xhosa and Kersvader se Nuwe Helpers in Afrikaans tells what happens when Santa is stuck in the middle of the African bush, with exhausted reindeer and lots of gifts still to deliver. Eventually, help comes from a surprising source . . . The books have pages in the back with photographs of African animals and places where kids can tick off when they see them. The books will retail for R180 each and are on sale at various stockists and on the online store elgeckopublishing.co.za. More information from and RSVP to Sue, 083-261-9671 or Theresa, 082-443-3840.
