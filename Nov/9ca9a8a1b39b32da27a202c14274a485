ON A TROT: Chippa United s James Okwuosa says the Chilli Boys are fired up. Picture:GALLO IMAGES A victory against Cape Town City is crucial for the team to win back the hearts of their supporters, says Chippa United captain James Okwuosa. The Port Elizabeth side play City in a Premier Soccer League fixture at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). The Chilli Boys have not won a league match in their last four, their most recent result a 1-0 loss to Bidvest Wits. The Nigerian defender said the next game was a great opportunity for the team to redeem themselves. We know we have not been doing well of late, having lost a game to Wits and playing two home draws, Okwuosa said. This is a great opportunity for us to redeem ourselves. The fans mean a lot, they have been an inspiration to us. They boost us a lot both home and away, which is vital to us.&#8221; Seeing them coming out in their numbers, raining or not, has been a great motivation. Those who have the team in their minds should try to give them all our best to make them happy. The skipper said the spirit in the team was high and that the players were ready to take on the Cape Town side on Saturday. He said the players had been putting in extra effort to see that the team bounces back to winning form once more. The last time Chippa tasted victory was last month against league rookies Baroka. This game is vital to us as we [have] a very tough game against Pirates on Tuesday. We are trying to keep the form, not only at home. We have never been beaten at home this season. Okwuosa, 26, said City was not a threat. However, he said the most important thing was not to concede goals on Saturday. That will be our No 1 priority because if we don t concede we won t lose. So we are trying to avoid that. Chippa are now eighth on the log with nine points from seven games, having lost two, drawn three and won two of their matches.
