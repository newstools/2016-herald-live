Xolani Dezide shows his September and October municipal bills for which he owed R2.1-million Picture: MARK ANDREWS/ Daily Dispatch An indigent East London resident, who had been incorrectly billed a staggering R2.1-million by the Buffalo City Metro (BCM), can now sleep peacefully as the debacle has been sorted out. In fact, Xolani Dezide s account for his RDP house in NU11, Mdantsane has a credit of R229. The security guard had been worried he could lose the family home due to the debt. It was reported last week how Dezide was slapped with the bill in September. Yesterday, he said he was relieved the saga had been resolved. When I went to the Mdantsane City Mall municipal offices on Saturday, I was told my account had been sorted out. Scores of residents had complained about the city s billing system being in a shambles. On October 22, BCM embarked on a month-long campaign to rectify incorrect bills. Of Dezide s bill, metro spokesman Sibusiso Cindi said: The credit is not a result of over payment, but of the subsidy that the consumer is receiving on a monthly basis. East London Ratepayers Association secretary Christo Theart accused the metro of not being transparent with its billing system.
