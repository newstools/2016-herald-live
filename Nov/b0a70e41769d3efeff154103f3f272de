The development of rugby in the province could be seriously hamstrung with the news that the EP Rugby Academy may close its doors because of a lack of funding. The academy s main benefactor, the SA Rugby Union (Saru), has pulled the plug on funding and is now trying to source an outside sponsor. An amount of R4-million a year is required for the academy to run at optimum level, but Saru has been pouring money into certain affiliates in recent years, including the beleaguered EP Rugby Union (EPRU), and the coffers may be running on empty. Another factor is that the R35-million received from the National Lottery for the EP, Boland, South Western Districts and Border academies in 2013 has apparently been exhausted. At this stage, it is believed there may only be one Saru academy that will be based in Boland. The EP academy, under the guidance of former Springbok Robbi Kempson, has been the most successful academy in South Africa, with 42 full-time professional rugby players of colour coming through its ranks in the last three years. Sergeal Petersen and Lizo Gqoboka joined the Springbok ranks recently, while Siviwe Soyizwapi is in the SA Sevens set-up.
