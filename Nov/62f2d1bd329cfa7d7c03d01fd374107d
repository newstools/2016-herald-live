Luthando Siyoni Picture: Brian Witbooi Alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni claimed on Monday morning that alleged triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke told him Christopher Panayiotou asked him to kill his wife, Jayde. The about turn in his testimony &#8211; once again &#8211; shocked counsel for the state and defence. Siyoni told the Port Elizabeth High Court that sometime after April 21 last year, Vumazonke gave him a lift to Infinity night club and informed him that Panayiotou was now avoiding him. WATCH: Jayde witness shocks court Defence advocate Terry Price SC objected to the evidence being hearsay following Vumazonke&#8217;s death. Siyoni said Panayiotou asked him to give Vumazonke a plastic bag containing cash and not to speak of it again. Siyoni counted out R50 000, gave that to Vumazonke and then kept R30 000 for himself. Jayde s kidnapping and murder was allegedly orchestrated by Panayiotou, 30. The state alleges Siyoni hired hitmen Vumazonke and Sinethemba Nemembe to carry out the hit. Zolani Sibeko is charged as a co-conspirator. Testimony continues &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
