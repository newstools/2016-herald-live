BLAZING BARRICADE: Illegal Khayamnandi residents blocked Old Uitenhage Road before sunrise yesterday to protest about the RDP housing project in the area. Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Residents who occupied land illegally at Khayamnandi s toilet city will hear their fate today as the Port Elizabeth High Court is expected to make a ruling on whether they should be evicted. This, after mediation attempts between the residents and the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality failed on Friday. The residents, previously back yard dwellers in various parts of the metro, took to the streets in protest yesterday, vowing not to move. They claim they were given municipal eviction letters in June, forcing them to approach Legal Aid to avoid being removed by force. The case has been postponed several times and is expected to be heard today. Whatever the court decides, the residents have vowed to stay put. Yesterday, about 200 residents blocked Old Uitenhage Road with burning tyres.
