NO WAY OUT: Sylvester the escape artist is settling into his new home at Addo Picture: ATHENA O REILLY The country s most famous lion has taken the first step towards reigning supreme over his new kingdom at the Addo Elephant National Park s Kuzuko contractual area. On Sunday, escape artist Sylvester was moved out of the holding boma he had called home for the past six months, into a larger 200ha enclosure. Arguably South Africa s most famous lion after he escaped twice within months from the Karoo National Park, Sylvester will stay with the younger male he has been bonding with in the boma since May. He has also been joined by two lionesses. South African National Parks spokeswoman Fayroush Ludick said: The decision to let them out was based on the park management s opinion that the two had settled and bonded sufficiently to start a new coalition and lead Kuzuko s pride in future. A carcass was deposited nearby to lure them out of the boma. The two females came out first, followed by the younger lion. Then Sylvester arrived, chasing the lionesses off and returning to the feast. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
