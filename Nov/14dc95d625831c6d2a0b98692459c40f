Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane s contribution to the #coffincase debate over two white men who assaulted a black man and put him in a coffin received a mostly disapproving response from fellow Twitter users on Wednesday. Waiting for the two #coffincase people who act in despicable manner against the South Africa we ought to build. Racism must be destroyed Maimane tweeted. Maimane was commenting on the case of Willem Oostheizen and Theo Martins Jackson who had been charged with assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The man abandoned their bail application at the Middelburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court and will appear in court in January next year. Maimane posted the tweet along with a picture of three men carrying rocks after the men s appearance.
