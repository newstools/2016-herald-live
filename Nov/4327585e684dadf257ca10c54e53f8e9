Agri SA greeted Sunday s announcement of a national minimum wage with a call &#8220;for in-depth research and consultation with all agricultural role-players especially farmers in drought stricken areas&#8221;. Neil Hamman chairperson of the agricultural industry association said on Monday that &#8220;whilst labour cost is a major cost driver a contented labour force is equally essential for optimum production&#8221;. &#8220;Compromising the intricate balance between wages and the sustainability of farming enterprises will however result in unintended consequences such as job losses and mechanisation &#8221; he added. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa announced with a panel of advisors the national minimum wage proposal of R3500 per month at the National Economic Development and Labour Council. Hamman said: &#8220;Agri SA welcomes the fact that struggling farmers still will have access to section 50 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act that makes provision for exemptions from ministerial determinations. &#8220;We also welcome that the fact that the expert advisory committee recommended that a lower mean apply to domestic and farm workers depending on the circumstances.&#8221; This point has annoyed some critics including the Economic Freedom Fighters which said on Sunday that it rejects &#8220;the idea that there must be exceptions for farmworkers and domestic workers&#8221;.
