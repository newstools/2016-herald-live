The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality s internal audit department will investigate 38 tip-offs of alleged corruption which were reported to the metro s new anti-fraud hotline. The hotline was launched by mayor Athol Trollip last month and has since received 45 tip-offs from the public. Trollip s office said in a statement details about the tip-offs would remain confidential until the findings were tabled in the council. Of the total number reported, only seven tip-offs fall outside the municipal mandate and have been referred to the relevant authorities to institute investigations against the alleged perpetrators, the statement said. It is clear that residents and municipal staff have taken this service into their confidence, given that each informant s identity is strictly protected and that this new administration is clearly serious about stopping corruption. Trollip s office claimed there was a deeply entrenched criminal culture in the municipality which had derailed strategic projects worth billions of rand. This is money that has been siphoned out of the city s coffers by greedy municipal officials and their political allies from the previous administration, the statement alleged. The city has appointed accounting firm KPMG to run its anti-fraud and corruption hotline to augment the metro s current internal forensic audit department. The hotline number is 0800-007-086.
