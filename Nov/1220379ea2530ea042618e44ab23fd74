The committee found window frames had been ripped out doors torn apart paving removed and toilets and basins smashed. &#8220;We can t allow the situation to continue like this &#8221; a visibly angry Mpisi said. &#8220;I don t understand why there are so many problems in the school and the department was not aware. If there are people who are not willing to ensure effective learning in our schools they should leave the system. &#8220;We can t allow learners who are supposed to learn to instead vandalise schools and use drugs without any consequences or intervention from the stakeholders. We call upon the community to work together to stop the rot in the school &#8221; Mpisi said. TMG Digital &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
