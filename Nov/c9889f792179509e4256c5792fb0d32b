ROYAL SECRET: A young girls whispers to Prince Harry as he attends a charities showcase on the second day of an official visit to the Caribbean. Picture :GETTY IMAGES It has been the great unwritten rule of Prince Harry s tour of the Caribbean whatever you do, do not mention his girlfriend Meghan Markle. Charity workers meeting the prince had been briefed that Markle was off-limits for small talk when meeting him, lest they should offend the prince by intruding on his private life. It had all been going so well, until the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda decided to have a little fun at Harry s expense by suggesting he might choose the country for his honeymoon with his new princess . It would have been bad enough if Gaston Browne s comments had been whispered into the prince s ear, but they were delivered during a speech in front of an audience of 300 VIPs, with the prince, increasingly red-faced, standing on a stage for all to see. Brown s ill-judged speech was surely the most awkward ever given in honour of the fifth in line to the throne. I understand there may be a new addition to the royal family very soon? a grinning Browne said. I am told that there may be a princess, and I just want to say that should you make the decision to honeymoon, then Antigua and Barbuda want to welcome you.
