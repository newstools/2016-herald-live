Driver charged with reckless driving after alleged high-speed dice to arrive first at accident scene A Port Elizabeth tow-truck driver appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court yesterday for allegedly weaving into oncoming traffic and racing with another tow-truck on the way to an accident scene on the beachfront. Precision Tow-In driver Christiaan Beer, 21, was arrested late on Tuesday afternoon after speeding past a Nelson Mandela Bay municipal traffic official while allegedly racing a Crash Motors tow-truck. Beer appeared briefly on a charge of reckless and negligent driving. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said Beer had been arrested and released on a warning to appear in court yesterday. The court extended Beer s release after he was charged. Complaints of recklessness were raised recently at the emergency services coordinating committee meeting, where private ambulance providers and tow-truck drivers who work with them were warned that lawlessness on Bay roads would be stopped. The meeting came shortly after a crash involving private ambulances and a tow-truck response car in Buffelsfontein Road in Mount Pleasant while they were allegedly racing recklessly to an accident scene.
