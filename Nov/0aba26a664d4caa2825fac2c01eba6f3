Power utility Eskom conceded on Friday that hazard assessments for the proposed Thyspunt nuclear site were accurate and that its own assessment had already identified that the area was seismically active 10 000 years ago. It was reported that a geological study had concluded that it would be almost impossible to safely construct a nuclear power station at Thyspunt because of deep canyons in the bedrock hidden by sand and soft rock. Thyspunt 90km from Port Elizabeth is one of Eskom s three sites identified for possible construction of a power station and is now the preferred site. Last year, Eskom applied for nuclear installation site licences for Thyspunt and Duynefontein in the Western Cape. The study by NMMU s Africa Earth Observatory Unit also concluded that the area was at risk of storm surges as a result of climate change and that it risked devastation from tsunamis. Eskom said in a statement: That work was incorporated in the Thyspunt seismic hazard calculations and is reflected in the seismic design input that will be used for the design of the power stations. The report read: At Thyspunt aquifer systems and valleys/canyons beneath the sands may not be able to protect large tidal swamps and/or tsunami waves from flooding across the bedrock below sea level. Thus it would appear irresponsible to build a nuclear power station at this site. BusinessLive Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
