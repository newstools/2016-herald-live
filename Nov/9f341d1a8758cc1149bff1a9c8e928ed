&nbsp; All collected pieces will be exhibited and sold for R100 each Port Elizabeth art centre ArtEC is hosting its popular Drawing Stokvel for the second time next week, and it will be open for business every day for a week at ArtEC and for two weeks at a new venue in New Brighton, No 3 Studio. The ArtEC week is from November 14 to 19 at the gallery at 36-38 Bird Street in Central, and at No 3 Studio in 5 Tabata Street, New Brighton, from November 14 to 25. Initiated by former ArtEC manager Nicholas Hauser in June this year, the Drawing Stokvel project welcomes everyone, practicing artist or not, to contribute to the stokvel of A4-sized drawings. When there are enough drawings, an exhibition and sale will be held with each piece going for R100. The project, initially only held at the Central venue, has branched out to be more inclusive, said ArtEC gallery manager Nompumezo Gubevu. Our mandate is to try and reach other spaces other than Central, which is why we have chosen to collaborate and be more accessible, Gubevu said. She describes the project as a platform for freedom of expression and says it also serves as a good networking space. Paper and pencils are set up but you are welcome to bring your own materials. Contribute R5 with each drawing to become a part of the stokvel and have your piece on the wall. ArtEC opens from 9am to 4pm on weekdays and No 3 Studio from 9.30am to 5.30pm on weekdays.
