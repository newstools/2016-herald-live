&#8216;Not Working&#8217; by Lisa Owens Not Working by Lisa Owens (Picador) This is a debut novel and the blurb on the back cover promises a story that is funny, sharp, tender and brilliantly observed&#8221;. Just the book to cheer the reviewer up during a post-op convalescence, it seemed. Actually, no. Amusing at times but not laugh-out-loud funny. Sharp and tender? Neither hit-in-the-stomach moving, nor particularly insightful. Brilliantly observed? A boring narrative of how to do almost nothing all day. The narrator is Claire, who has quit her job to find her meaning in life. It is a very ordinary kind of life and she makes no amazing discoveries about that life nor about her purpose in it. A reviewer should not evaluate a book before having read it through. However, it was a chore to get to the end.
