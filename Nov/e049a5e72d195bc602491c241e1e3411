Family and friends of four Somali businessmen are devastated by the horrific death of the popular shopkeepers, who died in a blaze which gutted their spaza shop in Soweto-on-Sea early yesterday. The victims Ahmed Hurshe, 42, Hussein Gabow, 38, Rasheed Abdi, 30, and Aweys Abdi, 30 who lived on the second storey of Nqolonbeni Spaza in Eluphumlweni Street, were asleep when the fire started in the downstairs kitchen shortly after 2am. Family members who rushed to the scene were shocked when looters demanded access to the premises to help themselves to what was left inside. Neighbours, who described the shopkeepers as generous and caring, are haunted by their cries for help. Next-door neighbour Lusanda Kala, 20, said she had been wakened by a call from her uncle a few streets away. When I woke up, all I saw was smoke coming from the windows the big flames were mostly on the top side of the shop, she said. We heard a window breaking it seemed like they were trying to get out, but because the windows have burglar bars, they were trapped. People loved this shop and the shopkeepers.
