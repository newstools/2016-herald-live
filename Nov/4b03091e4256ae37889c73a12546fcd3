Mitchell Starc of Australia celebrates dismissing South Africa&#8217;s Stephen Cook during day one of the Third Test match between Australia and South Africa Picture: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images Stephen Cook used an early reprieve to make his highest score of the series on the first day of the third Test between Australia and South Africa in Adelaide on Thursday. Cook was given out lbw to Mitchell Starc for four with the 18th ball of the match but replays showed Starc had overstepped. At tea which South Africa reached on 89/3 Cook was 40 not out with Faf du Plessis on 26 in a steadying stand of 45. Cook s effort was his best in his nine innings across all formats and at all levels and only the second time in those trips to the crease that he has reached 20. Du Plessis chose to bat after winning the toss for the third time in the series. But the visitors slumped to 44/3 in the first hour with Dean Elgar Hashim Amla and JP Duminy all back in the hut. Elgar edged Starc to third slip in the seventh over while Josh Hazlewood had Amla caught at first slip and Duminy taken by the wicketkeeper. Hazlewood who ended the session with 2/19 has dismissed Amla in all of his four innings in the series but his delivery to remove Duminy came close to being ruled a no-ball. Left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi replaced left-arm orthodox spinner Keshav Maharaj in the only change to the South African team that clinched the series 2-0 in Hobart last week. Du Plessis was booed when he came in to bat presumably over his conviction on Tuesday for ball-tampering during the Hobart test. The third Test is South Africa s first pink-ball day/night Test.
