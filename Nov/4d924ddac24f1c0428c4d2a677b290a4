Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli File picture: Gallo Images / Nardus Engelbrecht The man who will preside over Thursday s motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma said he hopes things do not go as chaotic as they often do during such a debate . It s difficult to know whether there will be trouble but from past experience we can assume some of that might happen today Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said. He told Radio 702 that while the house s rules expressly define what a point of order should be unfortunately in many instances people do not even follow the rules they use them as political platforms in a sense . This is why we often we have to tell them to sit down he laughed. He acknowledged the task is difficult but said it comes with the territory. This is the nature of the political environment. People abuse the rules. It s not just in politics by the way. In the sporting field people play tricks and so on and assume that the referee or the linesman didn t see anything Tsenoli said. And like faking sportsmen when they are called out they act surprised and throw up their arms as if they are innocent he chortled. The Democratic Alliance called for the debate after the court-ordered release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report.
