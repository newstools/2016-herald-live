More than 140 welfare, charity and educational institutions are set to get a cash boost totalling about R6-million from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. The metro hopes to pay out the money before the end of the year. However, it is likely to be a bleak Christmas for about 70 other sports bodies, NGOs and welfare associations whose applications were turned down by the municipality. A report detailing how the money would be split was discussed and approved at a mayoral committee meeting on Wednesday. Some of the organisations that are set to benefit include Community Chest (R1-million), Safa Nelson Mandela Bay (R750 000), the National Sea Rescue Institute (R350 000), Rape Crisis Centre (R150 000) and African Scholars Fund (R150 000). Some of the applications refused include the South End Museum Trust, EP Rugby Union (EPRU), Northern Areas Football Association and the ACVV homes. EPRU has already been given R6-million, which was allocated in the budget for the 2016-17 financial year. Budget and treasury portfolio head Retief Odendaal said it had been difficult to select those who would benefit from the grant-in-aid budget.
