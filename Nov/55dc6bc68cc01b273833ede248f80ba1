Musicians from left, Siviwe Bonase, Zola Nzenze, Masixole Daki and Cwenga Nomnganga Picture: Supplied The South African Disabled Musicians Association will deliver a concert with a difference on Saturday at the Feather Market Centre, featuring recorded disabled musicians from the province. Sadma chairman John Mothupeng, a blind musician, said the idea of the concert was two-fold. We wanted to expose recording artists, especially here in the Eastern Cape, and make the event more attractive for guests by having a large number of artists perform and entertain them, Mothupeng said. Eastern Cape artists include Sthembele Matu, a traditional Xhosa musician from Mthatha, Xhosa rappers Cwenga Nomnganga, from Komani, and Siviwe Bonase and Zola Nzenze from Walmer Township, supported by musicians from around the country. Bay poet and songstress Lelethu Poetic Soul Mahambehlala will also grace the stage. Mothupeng said Sadma, an NPO, was formed to identify disabled musicians from around the country, and enable them to record their music. Sadma has a recording studio especially designed to serve the particular needs of blind and physically disabled musicians. We had a talent search a few years back where we chose who we thought were talented and what we needed. Many musicians don t have formal training so we brought the artists in to the studio, brushed them up and improved what they had without tampering with their authenticity, Mathupeng said. Tickets at R200 per person include a buffet lunch and the concert starts at 3pm.
