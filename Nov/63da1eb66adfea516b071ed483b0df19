ANGRY: East London businesswoman Nandipha Bhali says Balfour must take her to court for the controversial advert and she will answer there. INSET: A cut-out of the birthday advert Picture: STEPHANIE LLOYD A jilted mistress dumped by a prominent Eastern Cape businessman got her revenge recently when she placed an advert in the Daily Dispatch newspaper thanking him for giving her a daughter. The advert in the classified section of the newspaper featured a photograph of Mthatha businessman Phumelele Balfour alongside a photograph of a two-year-old girl purported to be his child with local businesswoman Nandipha Bhali. A social media storm has erupted since the advert appeared on November 11. Supporters of the businessman, including a member of his family, have taken to social media to attack Bhali. They are accusing her of trying to break up his marriage. Bhali s supporters have in turn called on the businessman to take responsibility for his love child. The married Mthatha garage owner lives in an affluent East London suburb with his family. Bhali, a Beacon Bay-based businesswoman, last year founded a consulting company. In the advert Bhali writes to Balfour, reminding him that it is his one and only daughter s second birthday. She states that Balfour personally named the child. This was the day I became a mother after we lost our first child. I still appreciate his tremendous support and for giving me another chance to have this gift of life. I still hear the sound of [Balfour s] voice in my ears when the doctor confirmed it was a girl. Asked for comment yesterday, Bhali said if Balfour was offended by the advert he should take it up with the courts. A source said: He does not deny that he had an affair with her. He confessed it [to] his wife and they put it all behind them; they continued with their lives, then all of a sudden this started.
