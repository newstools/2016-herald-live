A primary school has scrapped homework after the move was backed in a poll by parents and pupils. Children at the 193-pupil Inverlochy Primary School in Fort William, Scotland, have been urged instead to use the time they would have spent on homework to read books, magazines and comics. Nearly 80% of pupils and 62% of parents supported the move at the Highland school, while the 10 teachers were split down the middle. The school carried out a six-week trial last year during which pupils were given no homework so that they had more time to play.Pupils were then sent home with slips that asked their parents to respond with a simple yes or no to a no-homework policy. &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
