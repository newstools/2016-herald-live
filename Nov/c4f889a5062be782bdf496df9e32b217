Port Elizabeth motorists can breathe a sigh of relief as the roadworks on the N2 between Port Elizabeth s western suburbs and Coega are now completed. South African National Roads Agency SOC Ltd southern region manager Mbulelo Peterson confirmed the completion a month before its scheduled finish. We want to thank motorists and the public for their patience and understanding, he said. The R198-million project started in July last year and entailed the surfacing of a 28km dual carriageway section of the N2. The expected road maintenance life span is between eight to 10 years before any major maintenance work will be carried out on the road, Petersen said.
