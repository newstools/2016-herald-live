Three women drowned and another one burnt to death after a boat caught fire at Hartbeespoort Dam Picture: CRIME AIR NETWORK A husband has recounted the last moments he spent with his wife on the boat cruise in Hartbeespoort Dam North West which ended tragically on Saturday. Four women died including Nhlonipho Mnguni&#8217;s wife Gwen when the cruise boat caught fire in the dam. Mnguni of Diepkloof Soweto said the accident happened just after 2pm as they were about to have lunch. He said the boat was stationary when the blaze started prompting him to run around to find a fire extinguisher to help put it out. He did not know that his 33-year-old wife was trapped in the ferry&#8217;s toilet. &#8220;I do not know how or where the fire started. All I remember is that I was running around and helping extinguish the fire. I had no idea my wife was trapped in the toilet &#8221; said Mnguni who had been married to Gwen for five years. Mnguni said when the fire started to get stronger he began searching for his wife as other passengers were being loaded onto smaller rescue boats. &#8220;There were already people leaving in rescue boats and I assumed she was one of them. I assumed she was already rescued when I couldn&#8217;t find her.&#8221; He said a police officer later told them that there was someone trapped in the ferry. They were also told that a body had been retrieved from the toilet and that he should go and identify it. &#8220;I was not expecting it would be her. It was just a formality for me. So when I saw her body it was a shock and immediate devastation &#8221; Mnguni said as he fought to hold back tears. He said she died of smoke inhalation and was not burnt as earlier reported. The couple had joined their long-term friends on the cruise as the Mngunis celebrated their fifth-year wedding anniversary. They had known each other for 14 years, and got married on October 22 and had three children aged 17-months, seven and 12 years. &#8220;We had taken our children to their aunt&#8217;s house. They are still there. They have not grasped what is happening. Even though they know the concept of a person passing away and going to heaven, it&#8217;s still hard to grasp that it is their mother,&#8221; Mnguni said. He said his wife was a claims manager at a financial institution. &#8220;My wife was joyful, loving, supportive, driven, committed and helpful. &#8220;She was a wonderful mother and wife. I will miss her love for our kids and family. She lived life to the fullest,&#8221; Mnguni said. -SowetanLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
