Three psychiatric patients who escaped from Livingstone Hospital yesterday while awaiting admission to a secure ward are still on the loose. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said nine psychiatric patients had escaped from the hospital in Port Elizabeth during a strike by security guards, but six of them had been found a few hours later at a nearby SA Social Security Agency paypoint. They had gone to collect their Christmas grants . Sassa is, in fact, paying grants early ahead of the festive season. The six patients were taken back to the hospital. Kupelo said while the three missing patients were not dangerous, they needed treatment urgently. The nine had been awaiting transfer to the secure psychiatric ward at Dora Nginza Hospital when they took off. Livingstone had no contact information for the families of the missing patients on file and police would be asked to help trace them.
