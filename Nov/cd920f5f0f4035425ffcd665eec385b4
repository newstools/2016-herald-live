Municipal spokesman turns to lawyer to block threat of possible disciplinary action Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Kupido Baron will not be bullied into resigning and will defend any stale allegations levelled against him about an anti-DA social media post. In a letter to acting city boss Johann Mettler, Baron s attorney, Grant Howard, has questioned the fairness of a threat to discipline Baron for a Facebook post shared on May 1 2014. Baron, who is a known ANC member and a former branch secretary, shared a poster which depicted white security police chasing a black boy. The DA s logo was on the poster along with the words Miss the days when the black man knew his place? Vote DA. KKKnow your DA . He later removed the post from his profile. Baron was summoned to Mettler s office two weeks ago, where it is believed he was taken to task for his anti-DA social media posts in 2014 and given an ultimatum to either resign or face disciplinary action. In Howard s letter sent to Mettler on Tuesday, he bemoaned the fact that Baron had not been fore warned that the meeting would be about a disciplinary matter.
