&nbsp; What a surprise! My day 1&#39;s! Known these amazing people and their families since we were kids in Durban. And no matter what happens, what we go through in life.. Our ups and downs. We will ALWAYS be family. @minniedlamini @nonigasa @mablerh @zakithi_mthembu #babymadida #madidababy #babyshower A photo posted by nandi_madida (@nandi_madida) on Nov 19, 2016 at 9:50pm PST TV personality Nandi Madida is set to welcome her little one any day now and to celebrate her bestie Minnie Dlamini threw her a surprise baby shower. Minnie got some of Nandi s closest friends and family together at the Marion on Nicol in Johannesburg on Saturday for a magical afternoon. Oh and did you notice all the blue balloons? Could this mean that Nandi is expecting a little boy? &nbsp; Dressed in a black-and-white striped shirt and casual pants Nandi s belly was on full display. Minnie took to Instagram after the day s festivities to write an adorable message to Nandi. I ve known you since I was seven years old and I cannot believe you are about to be a mom! Your beautiful heart is all you need to be great mother. I am so excited for you. Enjoy every second Minnie wrote. And of course what would a party be without a mannequin challenge? This one saw the party act out a scene where Nandi s water broke. Amazing! https://www.instagram.com/p/BM eltABN9o/ Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
