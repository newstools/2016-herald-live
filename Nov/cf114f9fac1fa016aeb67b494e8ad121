Father Jerry Browne in St Augustine s Cathedral in Central, which is celebrating 150 years Picture: Eugene Coetzee While St Augustine s Cathedral in Port Elizabeth is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, its congregants are looking to the future and hope to revitalise the Christian faith in the city centre. The church s year-long celebrations will reach their crowning point today with a floral art display that has been described as phenomenal. The display has been arranged by Gail Taverner, who has more than 30 years experience in the art form. Located in Whites Road, Central, the Catholic cathedral was first built as a parish church in 1866. In 1939 it was declared a cathedral when the Vicariate of the Eastern Cape was formally changed to the Vicariate of Port Elizabeth. Father Jerry Browne said the cathedral had become a place of solace over the years. We felt it necessary to honour the landmark and this spiritual home that has stood the test of time. He said the cathedral offered a sense of hope in difficult times and had become a place of refuge for many. It has also become a place where we journey with those who have lost their loved ones. It is a beautiful old building which symbolises hope, Browne said.
