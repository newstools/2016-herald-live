ANGRY SIT-IN: Divers and fishermen, some previously from Eyethu fisheries, in the boardroom Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Eastern Cape divers, fishermen and processors staged a sit-in at the offices of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) in Richmond Hill yesterday, demanding fishing rights, among other things.
