Minnie Dlamini Picture: Jackie Clausen The entire nation knows that Cassper Nyovest is completely smitten with Minnie Dlamini. He s even openly admitted that he ll marry her in a heartbeat. Even though Minnie has friendzoned the rapper on numerous occasions this hasn t stopped him from believing she would one day be hers. So if that day ever came: Cassper is willing to fork out R1 million for lobola in exchange for Minnie s hand in marriage as he s mentioned in songs before. In a totally unrelated post Minnie shared a picture of herself speaking about how a good personality outlives good looks. A pretty face gets old. A nice body will change. But a good woman will always be a good woman she said. A fan commented on Minnie s post saying that a good woman didn t need a R1 million lobola. A good woman don t need a milli she deserves a milli responded Minnie. Talk about knowing your worth! https://www.instagram.com/p/BNSXK4NgX1 / Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
