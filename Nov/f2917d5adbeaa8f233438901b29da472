Low voter turnout marked two Nelson Mandela Bay by-elections on Wednesday, but saw the ANC take a significant majority of votes in both Ward 4and Ward 14 to retain control of those areas. Councillors Ayanda Tyokwana (Ward 4, Walmer township)and Dolly Buti (Ward 14, New Brighton) were already attending to community issues at meetings in their respective wards yesterday. The ANC won by 77.89%, taking 4 242 out of the 5 488 votes cast in Ward 4. About 5 506 people did not vote. The DA received 748 votes and the EFF 359. In Ward 14, the ANC won by 67.54%, with 2 339 votes out of the 3 482 cast. About 6 666 people in Ward 14 did not vote. The DA received 837 votes and the EFF 215. Tyokwana said he had already begun his duties as councillor. Transparency, accountability and openness will be the key things in my office. I will always give feedback to the people, he said. Buti could not be reached for comment as she was in a meeting.
