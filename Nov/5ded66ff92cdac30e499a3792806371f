LOVING TOUCH: Tanja van Dyk with two of the babies that she and her husband, Braam, care for at the Hope Baby Safe Home which they have opened in their Westering home Picture: JUDY DE VEGA Project meets urgent need to protect abused, abandoned kids The efforts of a young Port Elizabeth couple will see six abandoned, abused and neglected babies receive loving care at a temporary safe home in Westering. After weathering the devastating death of their four- year-old son about six years ago due to meningitis, Tanja, 34, and Braam van Dyk, 32, have fulfilled their dream of caring for babies who have had a hard life from birth. Hope Baby Safe Home, a project of Vistarus Mission Station, opened in the couple s home in August. Tanja said: Starting a baby home has been our biggest dream and we are so hopeful for a great journey caring for these little ones, but we never thought it would become a reality this soon. After we met with a couple from Vistarus, we prayed about it. The establishment is not funded by the government and Tanja said they relied on donations and their own income to source necessities. My husband and I hold jobs apart from running the home and through our salaries we see to the needs of the babies [and also receive some] donations which have been great so far, Tanja said.
