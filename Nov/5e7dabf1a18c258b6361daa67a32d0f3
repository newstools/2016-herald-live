Dagga capsules were found among a stash of drugs confiscated from a South End duplex yesterday. Heroin and the capsules, believed to be filled with dagga oil, were confiscated. Detectives estimate the street value of the drugs to be about R500 000. A man was arrested after police raided The Heads in Gladstone Street shortly before 2am. The 39-year-old man, who is not being named until he is formally charged, is due to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s court today. Several police officials from the Crime Combating Unit raided the complex after receiving a tip-off that a flat was being used as a drug den. Police spokesman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said they raided the duplex once a warrant was obtained after receiving reliable information. The information suggests that the suspect deals in drugs from the flatlet in the complex, she alleged. Naidu said this was based on the quantity of drugs found inside the unit.
