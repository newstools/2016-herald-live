Picture: HETTY ZANTMAN/FINANCIAL MAIL The Food and Allied Workers Union (Fawu) on Monday rejected the proposed national minimum wage (NMW) of R3500 &#8220;as inappropriate and far from addressing the treble challenges of unemployment inequality and poverty&#8221;. Instead the union said it &#8220;will push for the NMW to be as low as R5700 a month&#8221;. Fawu general secretary Katishi Masemola said that Fawu &#8220;will not only make submissions but wage campaigns because this country cannot afford to be the case-study of treble challenges and social ills&#8221;. Fawu s campaign will call for: &#8211; The introduction of new taxes especially wealth and reparation taxes; &#8211; An increased rate of both PAYE and corporate taxes to apartheid-days levels; and &#8211; A 10% tax to cash reserves by all be it listed companies privately owned companies or NGOs/POBs trade unions and other civil society organisations. Masemola also said that Fawu does &#8220;not understand the rationale for a possible exclusion couched as special consideration to both the domestic sector employing close to 1.2-million workers and agricultural sector (employing about 800 000) in this newly announced proposed NMW&#8221;.
