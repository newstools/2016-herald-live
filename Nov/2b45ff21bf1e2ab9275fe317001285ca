The proposed national minimum wage in South Africa should be R3 500 a month. This is the proposal presented to the National Economic Development and Labour Council by a panel appointed to advise Nedlacon the level at which the country s national minimum wage should be set. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said labour government and business would need to take this proposal to their constituencies to decide whether or not this was acceptable to them. We are now a step closer to finalising discussions on the national minimum wage, he said. Ramaphosa said the parties would discuss the proposal and come back to Nedlacand, if there was agreement this would be made into legislation. He said the proposed national minimum wage was aimed at reducing income poverty and inequality. The chairman of the advisory panel, Professor ImraanValodia, said the panel proposed that wages in the domestic work sector should be set at 75% of the proposed national wage and workers in the agricultural sector should earn 90% of the proposed national wage.
