STANDING TOGETHER: Members and friends of the Sardinia Bay Surf Lifesaving Club Picture: IVOR MARKMAN Services suspended after 44 years with unblemished record After 44 years of volunteer service, more than 200 rescues and not a single drowning, the Sardinia Bay Lifesaving Club announced the suspension of its services yesterday and that it would join the Summerstrand Club. In a letter setting out reasons for their decision, veteran lifesavers said they believed the chances of their saving a life at Sardinia Bay had diminished dramatically. This follows a demolition order for their clubhouse by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality earlier this year. The clubhouse will be demolished by February. The members feel they can no longer carry out their duties in an efficient manner as they have done for the last 44 years, club secretary Sue Hoffmann said. There has not been a single drowning in this period.
