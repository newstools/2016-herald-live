Two years ago, the Eastern Cape s office of the premier purchased a million-rand videoconferencing unit but it has never been used and is gathering dust. So premier Phumulo Masualle s office has instituted a forensic investigation to determine how more than R970 000 was paid for a system that has never been fully functional since being installed. Director-general Marion Mbina-Mthembu, administrative head of Masualle s office, told the Bhisho legislature this week that a forensic investigation had been instituted after the system, supplied by Dimension Data at a cost of R970 232,could not be verified and was nonfunctional. The system was installed in the premier s tele media room in October2014, but has been giving officials in the premier s office headaches ever since. Mbina-Mthembu told the legislature s portfolio committee the system was not doing what it was procured for, creating a platform for the office to hold video calls with its stakeholders. Mbina-Mthembu said the system s non-functionality was picked up when a verification of assets was done earlier this year. For the video conference system, you could see the person on the other side, but they can t even see or hear you sometimes, as this system was not functioning fully. These revelations come just months after the same office installed a non-functional telephone system. According to a Dimension Data report compiled in March this year, the office was warned from the start about problems that would render the system unusable.
