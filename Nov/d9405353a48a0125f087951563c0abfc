Public order police have been called to Dora Nginza Hospital where Mafoko Security guards have embarked on a strike. By 11am, the strike had spread to Livingstone and Provincial hospitals. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge confirmed police were called to restore calm at the Zwide hospital after the security guards went inside and threatened personnel. The guards have since moved and are outside the hospital s gates. Dora Nginza interim chief executive officer Nonkululeko Dyasi needed an armed escort to enter the premises. Health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the strike was triggered by internal issues at Mafoko Security. He said they were sending a team, headed by the health department s head of security, to assist with security at the hospital.
