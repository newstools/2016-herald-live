The new medical school planned for Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University will be headed by Dora Nginza Hospital paediatrics department boss Dr Lungile Pepeta. Pepeta, 42, has already started to receive congratulatory messages from far and wide on being selected as the dean of the new medical school. Known for his advocacy and dedication to bringing high quality healthcare to the public sector, Pepeta said he was excited about the new challenge ahead. My major motivation is that we need more doctors. We are already training specialists. This is a golden opportunity for us to train more general practitioners, he said. Pepeta said he was excited to be part of the re-engineering of the health system to one that will focus on preventative medicine. NMMU announced in July that it had received the go-ahead to open a medical school in 2020. If all goes according to plan, the first intake for the MBChB degree will be in January 2020, and pre-medical training in 2017-18 if the necessary programme approvals are secured.
