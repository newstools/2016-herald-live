Melanie Wallis, left, and Jessica Perelson Women from Knysna, George and Port Elizabeth will be shaking what their mamma gave them on Saturday December 10, in a night of exotic dancing. Melanie Wallis and Jessica Perelson, owners of Zahra s Oriental Dance Studio, are presenting the show for charity at Rowallan Park Primary School, and said the weekend also included workshops. It s time for our annual student showcase fundraiser and this year we have chosen Sanitary Sista s, a BWA initiative, as our beneficiary, said Wallis said. Our sister studios Beli-zimo from Knysna and Fariha Belly Dance Studio from George will be joining us again and each teacher will be offering a workshop. Beli-Zimo includes, from left, Geraldine Robson-Parsons, Patricia Varga and Sue-Anne Ackerman Beli-Zimo director Patricia Varga has been dancing from when she was a tiny tot and her passion for dance brings women from all ages together in her Luv to Dance series, where they explore various styles of dance. Fariha director Levona Bredenkamp has been dancing and performing since 2005 and performed in the stage production Alice in Wonderland in Johannesburg last year. American belly dance superstar Jilliana created the international show. Bredenkamp also was first runner up in the 2016 CAID competition in Cape Town. Levona Bredenkamp Levona will also be presenting a workshop over the weekend, called The Mzing in my Danzing , said Wallis. She said the show would be held from 4-6pm in the school hall as Zahra s was a family-friendly dance studio and this time suited several of the members. This is a show you can take your five-year-old son to, she said about Zahra s belly dancing style. As opposed to exotic dancing, we work really hard to dispel the idea that it is something dirty. Entrance is R50 plus a pack of 20 sanitary pads. Further information from Wallis on 084-552-3187. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
