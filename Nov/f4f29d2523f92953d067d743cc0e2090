Communication systems in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality are being revamped to be more inclusive and engaging with the metro s residents. This was announced yesterday during an open session at the Woolboard Exchange where government-led social network GovChat was introduced to allow politicians to see how they can connect with residents regarding service delivery and governance issues. The session led by the municipality s communications office in collaboration with the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) included media presentations by Nkqubela FM and Bay TV and involved scrutinizing the municipality s interactive website and social media platforms. Council speaker Jonathan Lawack said these and other platforms would help in addressing the concerns of ordinary residents. Deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani said: GovChat . . . enables interactive communication with our constituencies as communities are already using social networks to air their views and concerns. Residents can follow the municipality by checking the website, like the municipality Facebook page (Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality) and follow them on Twitter at @NMBmunicipality. The GovChat portal can be accessed through www. govchat.org.za Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
