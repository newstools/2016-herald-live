ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu Picture: ESA ALEXANDER Anc chief whip Jackson Mthembu s stern warning to his MPs seems to have hit home, with the National Assembly managing to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill after twice failing. It was third time lucky for the ANC after managing to get the majority of its caucus to attend the sitting. Two previous votes failed due to absent ANC MPs. A total of 228 MPs voted for the passing of the bill, while 86 voted against it. There were no abstentions. The party issued a stern warning last week after several MPs failed to pitch for the crucial vote. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan had tabled the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill three weeks ago during the medium-term budget policy statement, which provided for a R5.41-billion adjustment to national budgets. ANC caucus spokesman Moloto Mothapo said their expectation was for all MPs to do their jobs across all political parties. You ll know that there was a challenge where quite a number of MPs were away on international visits and oversight, Mothapo said. But now all of those were back. Mothapo said the party welcomed the passing of the bill because it was important for the funding of service delivery, particularly for the poor. DA finance spokesman David Maynier said following a third three-line-whip, the ANC had finally managed to form a quorum and pass the bill. The failure to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill, despite two votes, two three-line-whips, and a barrage of text messages begging members to vote, is unprecedented in parliament, Maynier said.
