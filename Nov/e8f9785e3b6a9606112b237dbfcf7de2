City needs to invest R93m in troubled bus system to meet launch deadline In a race against time to spend R93.1-million on its troubled bus system before the April launch date, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality wants to by pass the tender processes yet again. The news comes as about R2.5-billion was ploughed into the Integrated Public Transport System (IPTS) over the past nine years and only a handful of the contracts went out to tender. City officials believe the municipality s lengthy procurement processes would hamper its plans to have the buses on the Cleary Park route in five months time. Last month, the national Treasury allocated R93.1-million towards the roll-out of the project money that must be spent by the end of the financial year, which is on June 30. The metro has, however, committed to a launch date in April for the Cleary Park route, which would run from Cleary Park to the Port Elizabeth central business district and NMMU. In a confidential report to the roads and transport committee, which met yesterday, director of roads, storm water and transportation Yusuf Gaffore proposed that the city piggy backs on existing tenders from other municipalities which have successfully implemented the IPTS. He said the metro was battling with severe staff shortages and did not have a number of requirements in place to go live in April.
