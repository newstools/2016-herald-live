Former ANC youth league leader Patrick Wisani in the Johannesburg High Court on 21 November 2016 Picture: Nomahlubi Jordaan The High Court in Johannesburg on Monday found former African National Congress Youth League Johannesburg leader Patrick Wisani guilty of the murder of his girlfriend. Wisani had been accused of beating Nosipho Mandleleni to death with a sjambok and broomstick in the room they shared in Yeoville Johannesburg in September 2015. He also faced charges of allegedly assaulting his late partner s twin sister Siphokazi and her friend in May 2016 in an apparent attempt to intimidate Siphokazi into not testifying against him. On Monday Judge Mohamed Ismail convicted Wisani on all three counts &#8211; murder assault and intimidation. When the dots are joined and the evidence put together it s pretty vivid and convincing that the accused is guilty &#8221; Ismail said. The court rejects his version and finds him guilty on all three counts. The court found that while the evidence of some state witnesses who placed Wisani at the scene had contradictions those contradictions were not of such a degree that their evidence should be rejected. Wisani denied assaulting his girlfriend despite Siphokazi seeing him carrying a broken broomstick on the morning she died. Ismail said Wisani had despite his advice not challenged the evidence of the state witnesses when he was cross-examining them.
