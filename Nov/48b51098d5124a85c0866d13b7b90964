Picture: TimesLIVE Jet went into immediate reverse thrust yesterday after a girls T-shirt bearing the slogan You can t sit with us sparked anger on social media. The Facebook outcry erupted after Cape Town graphic designer Clarissa Witten posted a photo of the T-shirt, saying it promoted segregation. And by yesterday the clothing chain had responded with a new design saying #You can SO sit with us . We have taken immediate measures to recall the T-shirt in question from all our stores, Jet spokesman Andile Simelane said. In her original post aimed at Jet, Witten said: With all the anti-bullying efforts of schools across the country, with children committing suicide, you sell clothing that promotes segregation? Witten said that as the mother of a seven-year-old, one of the worst things she could imagine would be if other children excluded her. She praised Jet for its response. I think it s very responsible. Just as people make mistakes, so do corporates. The quote on the T-shirt was taken from the 2004 comedy Mean Girls. In September, Target Australia was forced to pull a T-shirt off shelves after customers complained it was sexist. The Batgirl T-shirt featured a to-do list topped with the words dryclean cape .
