Manchester United&#8217;s Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring their first goal Picture: Darren Staples / REUTERS Wayne Rooney has apologised after inappropriate photos of him at a hotel party were released, but the England captain has been defended by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp who said all the game s greats drank like devils . Klopp said the episode was not serious. I know we re all on the sunny side of life. We earn a lot of money and do the job we love, but at the end maybe it comes as a surprise that we are also human beings too, he told a media conference. These boys, this generation, is the most professional generation of footballers there has ever been. All the guys, all the legends we love and admire, they drank like devils and smoked like crazy, but they were still good players. No one does it any more. I don t know anyone now. Rooney was thrown into the spotlight after The Sun tabloid alleged the Manchester United forward drunkenly gatecrashed a wedding at England s hotel in Watford, north of London, on Saturday. Media reports said up to 10 other England players who separately went to a nightclub had also been spoken to. A Football Association statement issued on Rooney s behalf said he had spoken to interim England coach Gareth Southgate and FA technical director Dan Ashworth to unreservedly apologise . He would like to further extend that apology to any young fans who have seen these pictures, it said. Rooney s representatives have, however, indicated that he believes he has been an unfair victim of the incessant media glare around top footballers.
