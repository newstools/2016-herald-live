A farmer in southern India committed suicide, fearing she would be left penniless after the government s shock decision to withdraw high-denomination notes from circulation. Kandukuri Vinoda, 55, had a large amount of cash at her home in 1 000and 500 rupee notes and panicked that her savings had become worthless when she heard Prime Minister Narendra Modi s surprise announcement on Tuesday. The family told us she panicked after hearing about the note ban and hanged herself at her home, a police officer said yesterday. Vinoda, of Mahabubabad district, east of Hyderabad city, had sold some land last month and was paid 5.5-millionrupees (R1.1-million) for it in cash. She used some of the money to pay her husband s medical bills and had plans to buy a new plot of land. Many Indians living in rural areas keep large amounts of cash at home because of a lack of banks in remote areas, and to avoid paying taxes. Police in northern Uttar Pradesh state said they were investigating reports that people were burning off sacks of notes to avoid declaring them and being landed with big fines. Bareilly district police chief Joginder Singh said: We have asked bank authorities to [certify] these as currency notes. Earlier this year, the government ran a four-month tax amnesty, which saw Indians declare nearly R123-billionin hidden wealth. But the scheme ended last month and anyone now depositing large amounts of cash could face a bill of up to 200% in back taxes.
