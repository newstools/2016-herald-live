HOUSING WOES: Residents protest at the Housing Development Agency over a building stoppage due to non-payment of contractors Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN A group of about 50 residents from Chatty 1060 staged a sit-in at the offices of the Housing Development Agency (HDA) in Port Elizabeth yesterday, complaining that housing contractors had not been paid. This, they said, delayed the delivery of houses to beneficiaries. The HDA builds houses on behalf of the Department of Human Settlements. At the sit-in, community leader Simphiwe Waka said beneficiaries were frustrated as workers had downed tools because they had not been paid. When contractors are not paid, they can t pay the workers who then close the projects. Beneficiaries are affected as they have to wait for a longer period to get their houses. These people have been approved for houses and it is stressful to stay in a shack knowing that your house is taking long to finish, Waka said. The residents also complained about badly built houses and that some of the houses did not have a proper sewerage system. Speaking on behalf of small, medium, micro enterprises (SMMEs), Mhleli Peter confirmed that housing projects had been closed in the Chatty area. Earlier this month, there were some contractors who were paid but not everyone. As a result, the workers don t want to work, he said. Provincial human settlements spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said some of the contractors would be paid this week. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
