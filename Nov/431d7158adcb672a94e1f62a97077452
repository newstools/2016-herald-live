TAP-AND-GO: The new technology will shorten queues Picture: Supplied Pick n Pay has introduced tap-and-go technology in its stores, and the JSE-listed retailer says this will significantly reduce queues at the tills. Contactless card payments do not require consumers to swipe cards, enter PIN numbers or give their signatures. Shoppers need only tap their cards against the card readers for payments to be processed. Pick n Pay said the service was now live in-store and available at all till points throughout its store network for both Visa and Mastercard bank cards for payments under R200. In September, Pick n Pay revealed that it was testing the efficiency of self-service checkout machines at one store in Cape Town. Pick n Pay will be the first major retailer in South Africa to introduce contactless card payments. Such transactions are popular with customers across the world. In Europe alone, more than three billion contactless transactions were processed in the past 12months. The service is also widely used in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Singapore and the UK.
