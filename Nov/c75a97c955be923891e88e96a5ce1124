Thousands of residents at three Eastern Cape municipalities face starting the new year in the dark after Eskom threatened to cut supply unless debt of a combined R143-million was settled. Eskom intends cutting supply in January to: The newly-merged Raymond Mhlaba Municipality which covers the university town of Alice, Fort Beaufort and Bedford; Walter Sisulu Municipality, which covers Aliwal North, Burgersdorp and Steynsburg; and The Dr Beyers Naude Municipality of Graaff-Reinet and Aberdeen. The three councils were formed after the August 3 local government elections when various unviable councils were merged. Eskom warned in an advert in The Herald s sister newspaper, the Daily Dispatch in East London, that these municipalities will be disconnected from January 11. Eskom said supply would be cut at certain intervals daily, while a total blackout was possible if debts were not addressed. Walter Sisulu owes more than R105-million, dating back to July2010, while Raymond Mhlaba owesR21-million since April. Dr Beyers Naude is indebted to the tune of R16.8-million. The power utility plans, as of January 11, to indefinitely cut supply between 6am and 8am and between 5pm and 7.30pm on weekdays. On Saturday and Sundays, supply would be cut between 8.30am and11am and between 3pm and 5.30pm. Eskom spokesman Zama Mpondwana said should the debt situation not improve, the utility would completely cut power indefinitely. Cooperative Governance MEC Fikile Xasa said yesterday the municipalities would not receive a bailout from Bhisho again.
