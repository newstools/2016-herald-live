In protest, small-scale fishermen who are angry and demand more fishing rights decided to sleep in the boardroom of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Richmond Hill. And while the group slept on the boardroom floor on Wednesday night, other protesters joined them yesterday outside the Stanley Street office. The divers, fishermen and processors were at the fisheries offices, demanding to speak to senior government officials. But when no officials turned up on Wednesday, the protesters sat on the boardroom floor and refused to leave. Eastern Cape Divers and Fishers Forum spokesman Romeo Hawkins said 25 people had slept in the room, including him. We put together chairs and tables to sleep. Others slept on the floor and we had two blankets, he said. We won t move until we get answers. Yesterday, the fishermen again demanded answers from the national office.
