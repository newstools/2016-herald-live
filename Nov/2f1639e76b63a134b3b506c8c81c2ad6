FINE FORM: Caleb Falconer celebrates another century for Herbert Hurd. Picture: Supplied Herbert Hurd Primary s Caleb Falconer has been in fine form for his school s U10A and U11A cricket teams of late. He has now scored three consecutive 100s for the two school teams in the past month. He first made 103 not out against Charlo Primary and then 118 against Graeme College (both U10As). He followed that up with an unbeaten 123 against St George s Prep on Saturday. His previous best score was 96, against Clarendon in January. Caleb is a true allrounder and besides cricket he is a talented swimmer, rugby player and hockey star. He also broke the 100m sprint and 1 000m records at the school s athletics day in September. His father Stuart Falconer, who is also head of cricket at Herbert Hurd, said: Besides the long hours practising in the nets, Caleb spends a lot of time practising on his own and he does his own research and analysis of the game he is so crazy about.
