What a lovely article regarding the Vistarus Hope home for babies ( PE couple provide safe home for babies , November 15). The Van Dyk couple are using their love for children to give hope to babies who need such love. When all around is bleak, there is bad news, with so much anger, bitterness and fighting, this article was like a breath of fresh air. Thank you. The Vistarus organisation is one of the biggest rescue organisations in Port Elizabeth. It looks after 400 people in its Sydenham property. I know that the public of Port Elizabeth also help in their support of the centre. Altogether, it says a lot of positive things for Port Elizabeth.
