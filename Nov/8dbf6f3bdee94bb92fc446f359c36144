STREET BLAZE: Tyres and other materials were set alight in the northern areas at the weekend as some people took Guy Fawkes night to extremes Picture : EUGENE COETZEE Emergency workers and police kept busy The skies across parts of Port Elizabeth s northern areas shone a bright hue of orange as residents celebrated the annual tradition of Guy Fawkes at the weekend. SAPS, emergency services and traffic officials were on high alert during much of Saturday evening as residents of the gang-riddled northern suburbs put on a show of a different kind. Three serious Guy Fawkes related injuries were treated by doctors at Livingstone Hospital, spokeswoman Busi Ngceshe said. A seven-year-old boy was treated for injuries but later discharged into his parents care, while a 10-year-old boy was referred to Port Elizabeth s Provincial Hospital for a consultation with eye doctors. A 25-year-old man is still in hospital with bone fractures. Provincial health spokesman Siyanda Manana said no Guy Fawkes-related injuries had been treated at Dora Nginza Hospital. No similar injuries were treated at the city s private hospitals. Incidents included tyres being set alight and some swung on the end of ropes. Traffic circles in Searle Road as well as Jameson Road in Schauderville were turned into flaming danger zones as fires, which were most probably started by burning tyres were fuelled by wooden pallets thrown on top of them. Motorists riding through Stanford Road were also pelted with stones and other objects as they drove past the Helenvale area.
