A Port Elizabeth mother s heart-wrenching plea in a letter to Social Development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi to keep the Lorraine and Algoa Frail Care Centres open, has summed up the affected families anguish: Dear MEC Sihlwayi I am appealing to you to rescind your decision to close down the only frail care centres Port Elizabeth has. I am shocked that such an inhumane decision could possibly be even considered. I have a daughter who has been living at Lorraine Frail Care Centre for ten years now and I have only praise and respect for the most wonderful team . . . very well organised, helpful, and accommodating . . . a dedicated staff who are trained to meet the needs of all residents. None of them deserve this kind of treatment! What has happened? I know if Nelson Mandela was alive today and still president of our country none of this would be happening. What about those poor patients, 36 in total, who died in Gauteng because they were dumped at a non-governmental organisation? Do you want a repeat of this incident, because this is what is going to happen if you close down these centres? I am asking you to have a clear conscience and do the right thing by keeping these centres going, thereby saving these poor souls as well as maintaining employment for these wonderful staff members. As much as we dearly love our daughter, we just cannot cope with her demands. My husband and I are in our sixties and we would find it extremely stressful having to look after her at home. We would also like the assurance that our daughter will be taken care of when we are no longer alive. I am appealing to you, also as a mother, to have some compassion and do the right thing.
