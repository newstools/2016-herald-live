What an outburst by Eskom board chairman Ben Ngubane! His sledging of former public protector Thuli Madonsela was a personal onslaught which was totally unnecessary and unwarranted. The State of Capture report appears (although I have to admit that I have not read the full 350 pages) to have been specifically phrased by Madonsela to enable all her research and findings to be the basis for the commission of inquiry that she instructed the chief justice to set up. Well done, Thuli. Now let the parties get on with what she has told them to do. All stakeholders will have an opportunity to refute the softly worded allegations Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe included.
