Alleged hitman Luthando Siyoni had to be told by his lawyer to sit up straight Picture: Deneesha Pillay Luthando Siyoni, the man who allegedly acted as a middleman between Christopher Panayiotou and the men who allegedly kidnapped and killed his wife, Jayde, has now denied being involved. Asked on Friday morning by prosecutor Marius Stander if he had been asked at any stage to find a contract killer, Siyoni replied: Never. While admitting to being friends with Sizwezakhe Vumazonke, who he met while working as a bouncer, Siyoni denied that he had been asked to arrange hitmen to kill any person. Change of plan on Siyoni testimony catches defence on wrong foot Jayde s kidnapping and murder was allegedly orchestrated by her husband. The state alleges Siyoni hired hitmen Vumazonke, who has since died, and Sinethemba Nemembe to carry out the hit. Zolani Sibeko is charged as a co-conspirator. Siyoni, the state&#8217;s Section 204 witness finally took the stand on Friday morning after another failed attempt by the defence to prevent him from testifying on the merits of the case. &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
