ALL MINE: Speaker Jonathan Lawack places the mayoral chain around Athol Trollip s neck to symbolise his election as mayor Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI Three opposition parties in Nelson Mandela Bay are calling on residents to join them in a mass march tomorrow against the DA-led coalition. The main gripe is the municipality s decision to block account holders from buying more electricity until their accounts have been paid up. The parties marching are the ANC, EFF and UF. The march will start at the Show grounds in North End at 10am. It will then proceed to the City Hall, where mayor Athol Trollip will be given a list of demands. Nelson Mandela Bay ANC regional task team convener Vuyani Limba said the petition would include more than 15 issues including alleged entrenched racism, abuse of power and harassment of officials. Buses will depart from the various wards this morning. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
