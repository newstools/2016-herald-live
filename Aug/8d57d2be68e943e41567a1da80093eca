Sarah Baartman District Municipality mayor Khunjuzwa Kekana Picture: AVUYILE MNGXITAMA-DIKO After it had received awards and accolades for good administration as one of the country s top municipalities, it came as no surprise that Khunjuzwa Kekana was re-elected mayor of Sarah Baartman District Municipality yesterday. Although she could boast that her district municipality was a shining example of clean governance, Kekana vowed to work hard to ensure that all staff adhered to supply chain laws.
