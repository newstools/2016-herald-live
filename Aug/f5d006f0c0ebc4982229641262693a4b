PAYING TRIBUTE: Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula speaks at the memorial service for the Rev Makhenkesi Stofile in Kwazakhele last night Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN Members will be forced to fix mistakes, Stofile mourners told ANC bigwigs Fikile Mbalula and Bheki Cele say they are happy that the ANC lost control of Nelson Mandela Bay because it will force the party to self-reflect and get rid of the rotten apples. Speaking at a memorial service in honour of struggle stalwart and former Eastern Cape premier Makhenkensi Stofile in Port Elizabeth last night, Mbalula and Cele said the ANC should use the election losses in the Bay, and other metropolitan municipalities, to improve on its mistakes. They were the main speakers at the memorial service held at the Lilian Ngoyi Sports Centre in Kwazakhele. Cele, who is a member of the ANC national executive committee, said the ANC s defeat would teach it about leadership. My heart aches, I won t lie. My pain is from the fact that we were here three weeks before the elections, saying to you guys that we should unite because if we lost the elections, we would be in prison for the next five years. Now we are in prison with no guarantee of parole. We are bleeding, but we should know that other [national] elections are coming. So, if we do not get rid of bad behaviour within the party, we won t come back. We should learn to behave. People must account to the ANC, so we should go back and review the loss, Cele said. He said the DA taking over would teach ANC members a valuable lesson on how to handle the power. The problem is that they [DA] will teach us how to handle power. We thought we would lead forever. So, it is a good thing we lost. We need to know that leadership is about serving the people.
