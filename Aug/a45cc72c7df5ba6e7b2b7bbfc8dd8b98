E-mail leak forces Ntshanyana to deny claims of collusion with ANC COPE s internal squabbles over the lone Nelson Mandela Bay council seat have escalated, with regional boss Khwezi Ntshanyana having to fend off claims that he is in cahoots with the ANC. Ntshanyana s personal e-mails, which contain details about his job application to the municipality and a draft coalition agreement sent to him by former mayor Danny Jordaan, were accessed and sent to his political principals. The e-mails were also forwarded to The Herald. This follows three weeks of conflict between COPE regional leaders about who should occupy the council seat. Ntshanyana said yesterday someone had tapped into his e-mails and forwarded them to COPE national leaders Mosiuoa Lekota, Willie Madisha and Dennis Bloem. The e-mails reveal that Ntshanyana was supposed to be interviewed on August 19 the day after the inaugural council meeting to elect a new political leadership for the position of manager of international and inter-governmental relations. He pulled out due to circumstances beyond his control . In a separate mail, Jordaan forwarded a draft coalition agreement to Ntshanyana which purports to be between the ANC, EFF, UDM, United Front, COPE, Patriotic Alliance, ACDP and AIC on August 11.
