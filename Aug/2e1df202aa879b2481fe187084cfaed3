In its first public statement as an opposition party, the ANC yesterday slammed the white male-dominated composition of the DA s recently appointed Nelson Mandela Bay mayoral committee. Bay mayor Athol Trollip appointed the new mayoral committee on Wednesday last week. In a statement released yesterday, ANC provincial secretary Lubabalo Mabuyane said the ANC was shocked by the composition of councillors on the committee. It is a skewed selection dominated by white males with only one black female in the team of 10 councillors, Mabuyane said. Trollip s decision to make up a mayoral committee dominated by one race and gender undermines the important need to ensure that women, black, Indian and coloured people who represent the majority of residents in the Bay are appointed to positions to drive transformation. It appears they hold a view that black people in general and black females in particular are not capable of being in leadership positions.
